The Court of Appeal dismissed a plaintiff’s challenge to his motor‑vehicle injury award, holding the trial judge was entitled to exclude evidence of a speculative “lost opportunity” to secure a lucrative employment contract. The panel reiterated that **loss‑of‑earning‑capacity claims must be grounded in cogent evidence of a real and substantial chance**, not mere aspiration. 

For litigators this decision underlines the importance of properly documenting career prospects and of preparing vocational experts to address them; defendants will welcome the court’s signal that inflated income projections will be scrutinised.
