# **Staying Ahead: Key Developments in BC Wills, Trusts, and Estates Law (2024-2025)**

**Introduction**

Navigating the legal landscape of Wills, Trusts, and Estates in British Columbia requires staying informed about ongoing developments. While major legislative overhauls like the introduction of the *Wills, Estates and Succession Act* (WESA) are infrequent, the law continuously evolves through court interpretations, regulatory updates, and societal shifts. For individuals planning their estates, beneficiaries, executors, and trustees, understanding these changes is crucial for ensuring intentions are met, disputes are minimized, and administration proceeds smoothly.

Recent developments in 2024-2025 underscore the dynamic nature of this field. Key themes include the ongoing refinement of WESA's application by the courts, the increasing integration of technology into the creation and execution of essential planning documents, the growing need to address modern complexities like digital assets and blended family structures, and the persistent influence of BC's probate system on estate planning strategies.

This article provides a general overview of these significant developments for our clients and the public. It is intended for informational purposes only and highlights areas where seeking personalized legal advice is essential for effective estate planning and administration in British Columbia.

**Key Developments in BC Wills, Trusts, and Estates Law (2024-2025)**

**(A) Judicial Interpretation Refining WESA and Estate Principles**

Since the comprehensive *Wills, Estates and Succession Act* (WESA) came into force on March 31, 2014, replacing several older statutes, British Columbia courts have played a vital role in interpreting its provisions and applying long-standing estate law principles within this modern framework.1 While the 2024-2025 period has not seen major legislative amendments to WESA itself based on available information, the evolution of the law continues through judicial decisions. Ongoing litigation and the focus of legal education resources suggest that understanding how courts apply WESA is paramount.3 Recent court lists include estate matters, indicating the steady flow of disputes requiring judicial resolution.

Key areas where judicial interpretation remains significant include:

* **Will Validity and Formal Requirements:** WESA sets out the basic requirements for a valid will: it must be in writing, signed by the will-maker (testator), and signed by two witnesses who are present at the same time.1 However, a significant feature of WESA is section 58, which grants the court the power to "cure" deficiencies. This means a document that doesn't meet the formal requirements (e.g., improper witnessing) may still be declared a valid will if the court is satisfied it represents the deceased's authentic testamentary intentions.1 Court decisions applying section 58 are crucial as they define the type and quality of evidence needed to prove testamentary intent in the absence of formal compliance.  
* **Testamentary Capacity and Undue Influence:** A will can be challenged if the will-maker lacked the necessary mental capacity (testamentary capacity) at the time of signing, or if they were subjected to undue influence. Testamentary capacity requires understanding the nature of making a will, the extent of one's property, and the potential claims of dependents.6 Undue influence involves coercion or manipulation that overcomes the will-maker's true wishes, resulting in a will that reflects the influencer's desires rather than the testator's.9 These challenges remain common grounds for estate litigation.4 Court decisions continue to clarify the legal tests, the types of evidence admissible (including medical evidence and testimony regarding the testator's circumstances), and who bears the burden of proof in these often complex and sensitive cases.9  
* **Wills Variation Claims (WESA s. 60):** Section 60 of WESA allows a surviving spouse (including a common-law spouse as defined by WESA 1) or children (biological or adopted, adult or minor 1) to apply to court to vary the terms of a will if it fails to make "adequate, just and equitable provision" for them.1 This provision balances the will-maker's freedom to dispose of their property as they wish (testamentary autonomy) against their legal and moral obligations to provide for their spouse and children. Court decisions interpreting section 60 are highly fact-specific and continue to evolve, particularly regarding what constitutes "adequate" provision in diverse circumstances, such as cases involving long marriages, second marriages or blended families, disabled adult children, or unexplained disinheritance.4 The strict 180-day limitation period for filing a claim, running from the date the grant of probate is issued, makes timely legal advice critical.10  
* **Rectification of Wills (WESA s. 59):** WESA section 59 grants the court the power to rectify a will – essentially, to correct errors or omissions – if the court determines that the will fails to carry out the will-maker's intentions due to an error arising from an accidental slip or omission, a misunderstanding, or a failure to give effect to the will-maker's instructions.7 Case law helps define the scope of this power and the evidence required to demonstrate the will-maker's true intentions.3

The ongoing judicial interpretation of WESA means that the practical application of the law is constantly being refined. While the statute provides the foundation, case law provides essential guidance on how its provisions operate in real-world scenarios. This dynamic underscores the importance for individuals creating estate plans, and for those involved in estate administration or disputes, to seek advice informed by the most current legal precedents. Relying solely on the text of the legislation may not provide a complete picture of one's rights and obligations.

**(B) Modernizing Incapacity Planning: The Rise of Remote Witnessing**

Effective planning for potential future incapacity is a cornerstone of comprehensive estate planning. In British Columbia, Enduring Powers of Attorney (POAs) and Representation Agreements (RAs) are the primary legal documents used for this purpose. An Enduring POA allows an adult (the donor) to appoint someone (the attorney) to make decisions about their financial and legal affairs, continuing even if the adult becomes mentally incapable.12 A Representation Agreement allows an adult to appoint someone (a representative) to make decisions about personal care and health care.14

Traditionally, the *Power of Attorney Act* and the *Representation Agreement Act* required these documents to be signed by the adult and witnesses in each other's physical presence.14 The COVID-19 pandemic, however, necessitated temporary measures allowing for remote witnessing using audio-visual technology.14 Recognizing the potential benefits of these measures beyond the pandemic, the BC Legislature passed Bill 27 in 2022\. This bill amended both Acts to grant the Lieutenant Governor in Council the authority to create regulations establishing permanent alternative processes for executing and witnessing these documents, explicitly contemplating remote witnessing.14

While the government indicated an intention to make the temporary remote witnessing measures permanent via these regulations 14, available legislative tracking information suggests these specific regulations under the *Power of Attorney Act* had not yet been brought into force as of early April 2025\.16 However, the broader trend towards accepting electronic processes is evident. For instance, amendments to the *Code of Professional Conduct for BC* came into effect in June 2024, establishing a process for the remote execution of affidavits and solemn declarations using electronic and video technology.17 Furthermore, BC law has permanently allowed for the creation of electronic wills and the use of remote witnessing for wills since December 1, 2021\.6

Once the regulations for remote witnessing of POAs and RAs are enacted, they will likely specify detailed requirements to ensure validity and prevent fraud. These could include defining what constitutes "presence" via electronic means, rules for signing documents in counterpart (separate copies), specific qualifications for witnesses participating remotely, and potentially requiring additional information within the documents themselves when an alternative process is used.14

The eventual implementation of permanent remote witnessing for POAs and RAs will mark a significant step forward in accessibility. It will benefit individuals in remote locations, those with mobility challenges, or others who find in-person meetings difficult. This modernization aligns incapacity planning documents with the technological flexibility already available for wills in BC.6 Until the regulations are officially in force, however, the traditional requirements for physical presence generally apply, unless temporary measures remain operative. When the new regulations are implemented, strict adherence to their specific requirements will be essential to ensure the validity of remotely witnessed POAs and RAs. This development reflects a considered legislative shift towards embracing technology in executing formal legal documents, balancing convenience and accessibility with the need for appropriate safeguards.

**(C) Emerging Challenge: Planning for Digital Assets**

The digital revolution has created a new category of assets that requires careful consideration in estate planning. Digital assets encompass a wide range of online accounts and electronically stored information, including email accounts, social media profiles, online banking and investment accounts, digital photographs and documents stored in the cloud, cryptocurrency holdings, loyalty program points, and domain names.18 Planning for the succession of these assets upon incapacity or death presents unique challenges not fully addressed by traditional estate laws.18

Key challenges include:

* **Identification and Access:** Executors or attorneys may be unaware of the existence of all digital assets. Even if known, accessing them can be difficult due to forgotten passwords, encryption, multi-factor authentication, and restrictive terms of service agreements imposed by online platforms, which may prohibit access by anyone other than the original account holder.18  
* **Ownership and Control:** Determining legal ownership can be complex, especially for assets created collaboratively, held in joint accounts, or acquired during a marriage or common-law relationship.18 The lines between ownership, licensing, and access rights can be blurred in the digital realm.  
* **Valuation:** Assigning a monetary value to certain digital assets, like cryptocurrencies, domain names, or valuable digital collections, can be challenging but necessary for estate administration and probate purposes.18  
* **Legal Framework:** British Columbia, like many jurisdictions, currently lacks a specific, comprehensive statutory framework governing the succession of digital assets.18 While WESA allows for the gifting of "property" by will 7, it doesn't provide detailed rules for handling the nuances of digital accounts and data. Issues are often governed by contract law (terms of service), privacy legislation, and general property principles, leading to uncertainty.18

Given these challenges, proactive planning is essential:

* **Create a Digital Asset Inventory:** Individuals should compile a detailed and secure list of their significant digital assets. This inventory should include account usernames, information about passwords or password manager access, security questions/answers, and instructions for accessing or dealing with each asset (e.g., close account, transfer contents, memorialize profile).18 This inventory should be stored securely and its location made known to the executor or attorney.  
* **Update Estate Planning Documents:** Wills and Powers of Attorney should be updated to explicitly address digital assets. This may involve granting the executor or attorney specific authority to access, manage, distribute, or dispose of digital assets and information. Consideration might be given to appointing a separate "digital executor" with specific technical expertise, although the legal validity and powers of such a role require careful drafting.18  
* **Understand Terms of Service:** Individuals should review the terms of service for their important online accounts to understand the platform's policies regarding access after death or incapacity.

Without specific planning, digital assets can be lost forever, valuable information may become inaccessible, and executors can face significant hurdles and potential liability. This area highlights how estate planning must continually adapt to technological advancements. The law often evolves more slowly than technology, creating gaps and uncertainties that require careful navigation through thoughtful planning and tailored legal advice.

**(D) Navigating Probate: Costs, Delays, and Planning Strategies**

Probate is the formal court process of validating a deceased person's will and officially confirming the authority of the executor named in the will to manage the estate. If the person died without a will (intestate), the court process involves appointing an administrator to manage the estate.19 In British Columbia, obtaining a Grant of Probate (or Grant of Administration) is often necessary before financial institutions or the Land Title Office will allow the executor or administrator to deal with certain assets, particularly real estate and accounts holding significant funds.19

While necessary in many cases, the probate process in BC involves several considerations that motivate many individuals to explore probate avoidance strategies:

* **Probate Fees:** BC imposes probate fees calculated on the gross value of the assets passing through the estate governed by the will. The fee is approximately 1.4% for the value of the estate exceeding $50,000 (with lower rates below that threshold). This equates to $14,000 in fees for every $1 million of estate value, making BC's probate fees among the highest in North America.11 Estates valued at $25,000 or less are generally exempt from probate fees.20  
* **Delays:** Obtaining a Grant can take several months due to document preparation (including the Notice of Proposed Application in Form P1 21), potential notice periods to beneficiaries and others 8, and court processing times. Furthermore, WESA generally prevents executors from distributing the estate to beneficiaries until 210 days after the Grant has been issued, primarily to allow time for potential wills variation claims.11 The entire administration process, from death to final distribution, can often take two to three years or longer for complex estates.11  
* **Public Disclosure:** The application for probate requires the executor to file an inventory listing the estate assets and their values. This information becomes part of the public court record, accessible to anyone upon payment of a small fee.11 Many individuals prefer to keep their financial affairs private.

Given these factors, various estate planning strategies are commonly used in BC to minimize the assets that are subject to probate:

* **Joint Tenancy with Right of Survivorship:** Assets owned as "joint tenants" (often used for real estate or bank accounts) automatically pass to the surviving joint tenant(s) upon the death of one owner, bypassing the will and the probate process. While simple and effective, especially between spouses, placing assets into joint tenancy with non-spouses (e.g., an adult child) requires careful consideration due to the potential presumption of resulting trust (meaning the asset may be deemed held in trust for the estate) and potential adverse tax consequences, such as triggering capital gains tax or losing the principal residence exemption.4  
* **Beneficiary Designations:** Life insurance policies, Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), and potentially First Home Savings Accounts allow the owner to designate a specific beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the proceeds directly upon death.19 These assets pass outside the will and are not subject to probate fees. Naming contingent (alternate) beneficiaries is crucial in case the primary beneficiary predeceases the account holder.  
* **Inter Vivos Trusts:** Assets can be transferred into a trust during the owner's lifetime (*inter vivos*). These assets are then owned by the trust and are not part of the individual's estate upon death, thus avoiding probate. For individuals aged 65 or older, Alter Ego Trusts (for one person) and Joint Partner Trusts (for a couple) are specific types of *inter vivos* trusts that allow assets to be transferred in without triggering immediate capital gains tax, while still providing control and benefit to the original owner(s) during their lifetime.4  
* **Multiple Wills:** British Columbia law permits the use of multiple wills. A common strategy involves creating a "General Will" that governs assets requiring a Grant of Probate to administer (e.g., real estate, accounts without designated beneficiaries) and a separate "Limited Will" governing assets that do not require probate (e.g., shares in a privately held corporation, personal effects, certain debts owed to the deceased).11 Only the General Will is submitted for probate, meaning probate fees are calculated only on the assets governed by that will. This can result in significant fee savings, reduced delays for distributing the Limited Will assets, and maintains privacy regarding the assets in the Limited Will.11 This strategy requires careful drafting to ensure the wills work together correctly and may necessitate appointing different executors for each will.11 A key consideration is that the 180-day limitation period for a wills variation claim under WESA s. 60 only begins to run for assets governed by a will once that will is probated. If the Limited Will is never probated, the window for challenging the distribution under that will technically remains open indefinitely, which may be a concern if disputes are anticipated.11

The significant costs, potential delays, and public nature of BC's probate system mean that probate planning remains a central element of estate planning advice. Selecting the appropriate strategies requires a careful analysis of the individual's assets, family situation, and goals, balancing the benefits of probate avoidance against potential risks, costs, and complexities of the planning techniques themselves.

**(E) The Interplay with Family Law & Blended Families**

Estate planning and administration are deeply intertwined with family law. Relationship formation, breakdown, and complex family structures significantly influence rights and obligations related to estates.4

Key intersections include:

* **Definition and Rights of Spouses:** WESA defines "spouse" to include not only legally married individuals but also those who have lived together in a marriage-like relationship for at least two years immediately before the relevant time (e.g., death).1 WESA also contemplates situations where a person might have more than one individual meeting the definition of "spouse" at the time of death (e.g., legally married but separated, and also in a new common-law relationship).1 Spouses have significant rights upon intestacy (dying without a will) 1 and possess the powerful right to apply to vary a will under WESA s. 60 if they believe inadequate provision has been made for them.1  
* **Effect of Divorce and Separation:** Under WESA s. 56, a divorce decree or a judicial separation automatically revokes any gifts made to the former spouse in a will and cancels any appointment of the former spouse as executor or trustee, unless the will explicitly states otherwise.22 While separation itself doesn't automatically revoke these provisions, it fundamentally changes the relationship and often necessitates updating estate plans.  
* **Family Law Agreements:** Cohabitation agreements, marriage agreements (prenuptial agreements), and separation agreements frequently contain clauses where spouses waive rights they might otherwise have against each other's estates, including the right to make a wills variation claim under WESA s. 60\. However, the enforceability of such waivers can be challenged in court, particularly if there was a lack of disclosure, duress, or if the agreement is found to be significantly unfair under the *Family Law Act*.4 Recent case law, such as *Schrader v. Schrader*, 2025 BCCA 50, demonstrates that separation agreements can be set aside for significant unfairness, for example, where property values used in the agreement were drastically inaccurate compared to the actual market value shortly after signing.23  
* **Blended Families:** Families formed through second or subsequent relationships, involving children from prior unions, present unique estate planning challenges.4 Balancing the desire to provide for a current spouse with obligations (legal or moral) towards children from a previous relationship requires careful planning. Wills variation claims are particularly common in blended family situations.10 Trusts (testamentary or inter vivos) are often used as tools to manage competing interests, for example, by providing income for a surviving spouse during their lifetime, with the capital ultimately passing to children.4

These intersections demonstrate that estate planning cannot be done in isolation from a client's family law situation. Estate plans must be robust enough to withstand potential challenges arising from family law principles and relationship dynamics. Similarly, family law agreements must be drafted with a clear understanding of their potential impact on estate rights and succession. Developments in family law, particularly court decisions regarding the enforceability of agreements or the rights of spouses, can have direct consequences for estate planning and litigation.

**Conclusion**

The landscape of Wills, Trusts, and Estates law in British Columbia continues to evolve, driven by judicial interpretation of WESA, the integration of technology, the emergence of new asset types, and the complexities of modern family structures. While major legislative changes to core statutes like WESA were not prominent in the 2024-2025 period based on available information, significant developments are occurring in how the law is applied and the types of issues practitioners and their clients must address.

Courts continue to shape the understanding of key WESA provisions related to will validity, capacity, undue influence, and wills variation claims. Technology is poised to further transform incapacity planning with the anticipated implementation of permanent remote witnessing for Powers of Attorney and Representation Agreements, following the earlier adoption of electronic wills. The rise of digital assets presents novel challenges requiring proactive planning and clear instructions in estate documents. Furthermore, the enduring impact of BC's probate system—its costs, delays, and public nature—means that strategies like joint ownership, beneficiary designations, trusts, and multiple wills remain central to many estate plans. Finally, the undeniable link between family law and estate law necessitates careful consideration of relationship status, agreements, and blended family dynamics when crafting any estate plan.

Navigating these complexities requires careful planning tailored to individual circumstances and goals. Ensuring your estate plan is up-to-date, reflects your current wishes, and addresses potential challenges is essential. We encourage you to seek professional legal advice to discuss your specific situation and develop a comprehensive plan that provides peace of mind for you and your loved ones.
