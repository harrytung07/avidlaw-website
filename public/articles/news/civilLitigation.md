# **Staying Informed: Key BC Civil Litigation Developments in 2024-2025**

The legal landscape is constantly evolving. For individuals and businesses in British Columbia, staying informed about significant changes in civil litigation is crucial, as these developments can directly impact their rights, obligations, and how they navigate potential legal disputes. The period between 2024 and 2025 saw several noteworthy shifts in case law, legislation, and court procedures.

This article highlights five key developments relevant to those involved in or contemplating civil court matters in BC. We will explore major court decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada, significant legislative amendments affecting consumer rights and business practices, evolving standards in privacy law, important clarifications regarding employment contracts, and the ongoing modernization of court processes through technology. Our aim is to provide practical insights in clear, accessible language for our clients and the public.

## **Key Development 1: Government-Led Class Actions Get Green Light from Supreme Court of Canada**

Context & Background:  
The devastating opioid crisis has imposed enormous healthcare costs on governments across Canada.1 In response, the British Columbia government launched a significant lawsuit in 2018 against dozens of opioid manufacturers, marketers, and distributors, alleging they contributed to the epidemic through deceptive marketing practices and seeking to recover the substantial public funds spent addressing the crisis.1  
Uniquely, BC aimed to represent not just its own interests but those of *all* federal, provincial, and territorial governments and agencies that had incurred similar opioid-related healthcare, pharmaceutical, and treatment costs. This proposed a novel form of national, government-only class action.2 To support this approach, the BC legislature enacted the *Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act* (ORA). A key provision, section 11, specifically authorized the BC government to act as the representative plaintiff for this proposed pan-Canadian class of governments.2

The Legal Challenge:  
Several defendant pharmaceutical companies challenged the constitutionality of section 11 of the ORA. They argued that BC was overstepping its legislative authority, violating constitutional principles that limit provincial powers to their own territory and respect the sovereignty of other governments.2 The defendants claimed that allowing BC to represent and potentially bind other governments without their explicit prior consent undermined the litigation autonomy and decision-making power of those other provinces and territories.4  
The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) Ruling (Sanis Health Inc. v British Columbia, 2024 SCC 40):  
In a landmark decision released in November 2024, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the defendants' appeal and upheld the constitutionality of section 11.1 The Court provided several key reasons for its decision:

* **Procedural Nature:** The Court determined that the primary purpose and effect – the "pith and substance" – of section 11 is procedural. It serves as a mechanism within BC's legal system to manage the existing opioid litigation under the province's class action rules. As such, it falls within the province's established powers over the administration of justice and civil procedure in its own courts.2  
* **Opt-Out Preserves Sovereignty:** The SCC found that section 11 does not improperly interfere with the substantive rights or sovereignty of other Canadian governments because the ORA provides an "opt-out" mechanism. Any federal, provincial, or territorial government included in the proposed class could choose not to participate in the BC-led action and pursue its own remedies if it wished.2 The Court noted that nearly all other governments supported BC's action and intended to participate, indicating their consent to this cooperative approach.4  
* **Cooperative Federalism:** The majority decision stressed the importance of "flexible" and "cooperative" federalism in addressing complex, multi-jurisdictional issues like the opioid crisis.1 National class actions were recognized as an efficient tool for achieving justice across provincial borders, promoting judicial economy and access to justice.1

Significance and Practical Implications:  
This ruling is highly significant and may indeed mark a "new era" for certain types of class actions in Canada.2 It confirms that provincial governments can, with supporting legislation, act as representative plaintiffs to pursue large-scale cost recovery on behalf of multiple governments facing shared harms.1  
This could encourage BC and other provinces to consider similar government-led class actions in other areas involving widespread public expenditures, such as environmental contamination or healthcare costs associated with other products.2 For businesses facing such lawsuits, this means potentially confronting a more powerful type of plaintiff. Governments possess considerable resources, access to information, and, crucially, the ability to enact specific legislation (like the ORA) to bolster their claims, altering the typical dynamics of class action litigation.2

The decision signals a pragmatic judicial approach, potentially prioritizing the efficient resolution of national problems over rigid interpretations of provincial boundaries, especially when mechanisms like opt-out allow for non-participation.4 While the opt-out feature was key here, particularly given the broad support from other governments 4, the ruling leaves open the possibility that future opt-out regimes could be scrutinized if they don't genuinely reflect voluntary participation.4

Following the SCC decision, the BC Supreme Court certified the opioid class action, allowing it to proceed towards trial.2

## **Key Development 2: Sweeping Changes to Consumer Protection Laws (Bill 4\)**

Context & Background:  
In early 2025, the BC government introduced Bill 4, the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Amendment Act, 2025\. This legislation represents the most significant overhaul of the province's consumer protection laws since 2004.7 The stated goals are to modernize the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act (BPCPA), enhance contract fairness and transparency, strengthen consumer rights, and combat predatory sales tactics, with a particular focus on protecting vulnerable groups like seniors and newcomers.7 Bill 4 passed its third reading in the legislature on March 13, 2025, and awaits Royal Assent and regulations to bring its provisions into force.10  
Key Amendments Introduced by Bill 4:  
The Bill introduces wide-ranging changes affecting many common business practices:

* **Prohibition on Certain Contract Terms (Affecting Litigation/Dispute Resolution):**  
  * **Class Action Waivers Banned:** Terms in consumer contracts that prevent consumers from starting or joining a class action lawsuit will be void.8  
  * **Mandatory Pre-Dispute Arbitration Banned:** Terms requiring consumers to submit disputes to arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes *before* a dispute arises will also be void.7 Importantly, parties can still mutually agree to use arbitration *after* a dispute has begun.12  
  * **Extension to B2B "Low Value Claims":** These prohibitions on class action waivers and mandatory pre-dispute arbitration will also apply to business-to-business (B2B) contracts if the dispute involves a "low value claim." The specific monetary threshold for a low-value claim will be defined later by regulation.7 For these claims, such clauses in B2B contracts will be deemed "inoperative."  
  * **Potential Retroactivity:** A critical point noted by legal commentators is the potential for these prohibitions on dispute resolution clauses to apply retroactively to contracts signed *before* Bill 4 comes into force.12  
* **Prohibition on Restricting Consumer Reviews:** Businesses cannot include terms in consumer contracts that prohibit consumers from posting reviews online or otherwise communicating their opinions about goods, services, or the transaction.8 Such restrictive terms will be void.13  
* **Enhanced Disclosure & Contract Requirements:** Businesses must provide consumers with clear, upfront disclosure of essential contract information *before* the contract is finalized. This includes details on price, delivery, payment terms, renewal conditions, cancellation rights, refund policies, and more.7 Failure to provide this information correctly can give the consumer the right to cancel the contract.8  
* **Subscription Contracts:** The Bill imposes strict rules on automatically renewing subscriptions:  
  * For renewal periods of 60 days or less, the automatic renewal clause is void unless the contract allows the consumer to cancel the renewal at any time without penalty.8  
  * For renewal periods longer than 60 days, businesses must provide advance notice of the renewal date. The renewal clause is void unless the consumer can cancel without penalty before the renewal date, or receive a pro-rated refund if cancelling after the renewal date.7  
  * Businesses are also restricted from unilaterally changing contract terms mid-subscription unless specific conditions are met.7  
* **Direct Sales Restrictions:** The Bill prohibits "direct sales" (defined as in-person sales outside a regular retail store, like door-to-door sales) of certain high-cost household goods and services. This includes items like furnaces, air conditioners, water heaters, home security systems, and duct cleaning services.7 Offering credit as part of a direct sale is also banned.9  
* **Expanded Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) Jurisdiction:** Consumers will gain the ability to bring claims for damages resulting from BPCPA violations directly to the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT). Previously, such claims generally had to be pursued in Provincial or Supreme Court.7

Significance and Practical Implications:  
Bill 4 marks a significant shift towards enhanced consumer protection, potentially altering the balance between businesses and consumers in BC.

* **For Consumers:** The amendments provide substantially stronger rights, increased transparency (especially for online purchases and subscriptions), easier contract cancellation options, protection from high-pressure door-to-door sales for certain items, and a more accessible venue (the CRT) for resolving disputes and seeking damages.9 The freedom to post reviews and participate in class actions without contractual barriers is also a major gain.  
* **For Businesses:** Compliance will require significant effort. Businesses must thoroughly review and revise their standard consumer contracts, online terms, subscription models, and sales practices (particularly direct sales).8 The voiding of class action waivers and mandatory arbitration clauses increases the risk of litigation, including class actions.8 Businesses involved in B2B transactions should also monitor the regulations defining "low value claims." Certain business models, especially those reliant on direct sales of the specified goods or particular subscription renewal structures, may face disruption.10 Overall compliance costs are expected to rise.11  
* **For Litigation:** An increase in consumer claims filed with the CRT is anticipated due to the expanded jurisdiction and lower barriers compared to court.12 The removal of pre-dispute arbitration and class action waivers could also lead to more individual court actions and class action filings.14 Litigation clarifying the scope of the new provisions, such as the definition of "low value claim" and the extent of retroactive application, is likely. While aligning BC with other provinces on banning consumer class action waivers, the extension to B2B low-value claims represents a potentially unique BC approach.15

The breadth and potential retroactivity of these changes signal a strong legislative intent to prioritize consumer protection, possibly at the expense of contractual certainty previously enjoyed by businesses operating under standard form agreements.

## **Key Development 3: Privacy Breach Liability Evolves – Recklessness May Suffice**

Context & Background:  
Data breaches are an unfortunate reality for modern organizations, potentially exposing sensitive personal information and leading to significant harm. Class action lawsuits are a common legal response, seeking compensation for affected individuals. In British Columbia, the Privacy Act provides a specific legal tool: it creates a statutory tort (a basis for a civil lawsuit) allowing individuals to sue for damages if their privacy has been violated "wilfully and without a claim of right," even without proving financial loss.22  
Separately, courts in Ontario developed a common law tort known as "intrusion upon seclusion," which requires proving an intentional or reckless intrusion into private affairs that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. BC courts have historically been more cautious about fully adopting this common law tort.23

This legal backdrop set the stage for *G.D. v. South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority* (TransLink). This case involved a proposed class action filed after malicious hackers breached TransLink's systems and accessed personal information belonging to employees, retirees, and some customers.22

The Lower Court Decision:  
The initial judge reviewing the case dismissed the application to certify it as a class action. The judge found the plaintiffs hadn't sufficiently established a basis for their claims, including under the Privacy Act or negligence. There was also a suggestion that BC's public sector privacy law, the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), might represent the complete set of obligations for public bodies like TransLink, potentially shielding them from other types of privacy claims.22  
The BC Court of Appeal (BCCA) Ruling (2024 BCCA 252):  
The BC Court of Appeal disagreed with the lower court and overturned the dismissal, sending the case back for reconsideration of certification.22 The BCCA made two critical findings:

1. **FIPPA Is Not a Complete Code:** The Court clarified that FIPPA does *not* prevent individuals from bringing other valid legal claims related to privacy breaches against public bodies. Statutory torts (like the one under the *Privacy Act*) or common law claims (like negligence) can still apply, even if FIPPA also imposes obligations.22  
2. **"Wilfully" May Include Recklessness:** Most significantly, the BCCA addressed the meaning of "wilfully" under the *Privacy Act*. It held that it is "at least arguable" that an organization's failure to take reasonable steps to safeguard personal information could amount to a *wilful* violation of privacy if that failure demonstrates *recklessness*.22 The Court suggested that "wilfully" could encompass not just intentional acts but also reckless indifference to the known duty to protect sensitive information.22 While acknowledging this interpretation marked an evolution in the law, the Court emphasized the need for legal deterrents to encourage robust data security measures.22

Supreme Court of Canada Action:  
In March 2025, the Supreme Court of Canada denied TransLink's request for leave to appeal the BCCA decision.22 This means the BCCA's interpretation – that recklessness might satisfy the "wilful" requirement under the BC Privacy Act in data breach cases – stands as the current law in British Columbia.  
Significance and Practical Implications:  
This development potentially lowers the bar for establishing liability against organizations under the BC Privacy Act following a data breach. Plaintiffs might not need to prove the organization intended for the breach to happen; showing that the organization was reckless in its security practices, leading to the breach, could arguably be enough.22  
This increases the litigation risk for both public and private sector organizations in BC that handle personal information. If a breach occurs, their security measures and overall diligence will face heightened scrutiny.22 It may also become easier to certify data breach class actions in BC based on the *Privacy Act*, as proving recklessness could be less challenging than proving intent or meeting the specific requirements of other torts like intrusion upon seclusion.23 This positions BC somewhat differently from other provinces where data breach class actions have faced increasing hurdles.26

Furthermore, the ruling confirms that simply complying with statutory data protection laws like FIPPA may not be enough to avoid civil liability if carelessness leads to a breach.22

The BCCA's approach creates a potentially distinct path for data breach litigation in BC, relying on a broader interpretation of the provincial *Privacy Act* rather than solely on common law torts used elsewhere.22 Combined with a noted rise in "data misuse" cases (claims about how companies themselves collect and use data, not just third-party breaches) 26, privacy litigation remains a complex and high-stakes area for organizations. The court's explicit policy reasoning—linking potential liability to incentivizing better security 22—suggests a judicial view that tort law should play a role in enforcing society's growing expectations for responsible data protection.

## **Key Development 4: Scrutiny on Employment Contract Formation – The Importance of "Fresh Consideration"**

Context & Background:  
The relationship between an employer and employee is fundamentally based on contract law. Often, the hiring process involves multiple documents – perhaps an initial offer letter outlining key terms, followed by a more detailed formal employment agreement presented later. A recurring legal issue arises when the later agreement introduces new terms, particularly those less favourable to the employee, such as clauses limiting severance pay upon termination. For such changes to be legally binding, a core principle of contract law generally requires "consideration" – essentially, something new of value must be exchanged between the parties. Simply continuing to employ someone is typically not considered sufficient "fresh" consideration to validate new, detrimental terms imposed after the initial hiring agreement is made.  
The Case: Adams v. Thinkific Labs Inc. (2024 BCSC 1129):  
This BC Supreme Court decision provides a clear illustration of this principle.27 The key facts were:

* An individual received a comprehensive email offer of employment detailing compensation, benefits, and vacation time. This offer did *not* include a termination clause that would limit her entitlement to common law reasonable notice if she were dismissed.27  
* She accepted this offer via email the next day, confirming her start date.27  
* Later that same day, the employer sent her a formal "Protection of Corporate Interests" document. This second document contained significant new terms that were not in the original offer, including an onerous termination clause limiting her severance pay to the minimums required by employment standards legislation, as well as non-competition restrictions.27 She signed and returned this document.27  
* Approximately 20 months later, her employment was terminated without cause. She sued for wrongful dismissal.27 Her argument was that the initial accepted offer letter constituted the complete and binding employment contract, and since it lacked a restrictive termination clause, she was entitled to common law reasonable notice. She argued the second agreement was unenforceable because she received no fresh consideration for signing it.27

The BCSC Ruling:  
The BC Supreme Court sided entirely with the employee.27 The court found that:

* The initial email offer, once accepted by the employee, formed a complete and legally binding employment contract.28  
* The second document, introducing new and significantly more restrictive terms (limiting severance, adding non-compete clauses), amounted to an attempted variation or amendment of the original contract.27  
* Crucially, the employer failed to provide any *fresh consideration* – such as a signing bonus, a salary increase beyond what was initially offered, a promotion, or some other tangible benefit – specifically in exchange for the employee agreeing to these new, less favourable terms.27  
* Therefore, the second agreement, including the termination clause aiming to limit severance, was unenforceable.27  
* As a result, the employee was entitled to common law reasonable notice of termination, which the court assessed at five months' pay in lieu of notice.27

Significance and Practical Implications:  
This decision serves as a critical reminder for employers and employees regarding the formation of employment contracts:

* **For Employers:** It is essential to include *all* intended terms of employment, especially potentially disadvantageous ones like termination clauses limiting common law notice, in the *initial* offer document that the prospective employee accepts.29 Using a two-step process where significant restrictive terms are introduced only *after* an initial offer has been accepted is legally perilous. If changes to the terms are necessary after acceptance, the employer must provide clear, new (or "fresh") consideration to the employee for those changes to be enforceable. Simply continuing the employment relationship is not enough.27 Attempting to rely on termination clauses added post-hire without fresh consideration is highly likely to fail in court.29  
* **For Employees:** This case highlights that an accepted offer letter can create binding contractual rights. If an employer asks an employee to sign a subsequent agreement containing terms that are less favourable than the original offer (e.g., limiting severance), the employee should be aware that this later agreement might not be legally enforceable if no new benefit or value was provided in return for signing it.

The *Adams* decision reinforces that courts will apply fundamental contract law principles rigorously in the employment context, protecting employees from unilateral imposition of detrimental terms after a binding agreement has been formed.30 It also shows the risks of using fragmented hiring documents; even an informal email, if sufficiently detailed and accepted, can establish the core contractual obligations.30

## **Key Development 5: Courts Modernize with Enhanced Technology & Procedural Updates**

Context & Background:  
British Columbia's court system, like others across Canada, is actively embracing technology to modernize its operations, aiming to improve efficiency, accessibility, and fairness. While the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of some technologies, the trend towards digital processes and remote access continues as part of a broader modernization effort. Several updates in 2024-2025 affect how civil litigants interact with the courts.  
**Key Technological/Procedural Updates (2024-2025):**

* **Supreme Court Online Booking System (COBS) Expansion:** The Supreme Court significantly expanded its online booking platform, COBS. Initially used for scheduling Case Planning Conferences (CPCs), Judicial Case Conferences (JCCs), and Trial Management Conferences (TMCs), COBS became available for booking civil and family *trials* starting November 1, 2024\.31 For the high-demand registries of Vancouver, New Westminster, and Victoria, using COBS is now strongly encouraged for trial bookings. This involves submitting preferred dates during a monthly "Booking Window," with dates allocated via a fairness algorithm rather than a first-come, first-served phone call.31 While traditional booking methods (phone, in-person) remain available for conferences and trials in less busy regions, the shift to COBS in major centres aims to improve fairness and efficiency in allocating limited court time.31 Access requires a BCeID or the BC Wallet digital credential.31  
* **Continued Use of Virtual Hearings:** Remote court appearances remain common. In Provincial Court family matters, short appearances and conferences are typically held remotely via telephone or Microsoft Teams unless a judge directs otherwise.32 Virtual options exist in other courts too, though availability depends on court resources and judicial approval.32 Parties must ensure they have the necessary technology for remote participation.32  
* **Electronic Filing (E-filing):** Filing court documents electronically is increasingly the norm. Court Services Online (CSO) facilitates e-filing for BC Supreme and Provincial Court matters.32 The Federal Court also operates its own E-Filing System.35 The Provincial Court accepts remote filings through various channels, including email and CSO where available, and is progressively digitizing court files for easier access.32 Adherence to specific formatting rules (e.g., searchable PDFs, page limits, bookmarks) is essential for e-filing.35  
* **Remote Commissioning of Affidavits Formalized:** The temporary measures allowing affidavits to be sworn or affirmed remotely via video technology during the pandemic have become permanent and regulated. In July 2024, the Law Society updated its Code of Professional Conduct (Appendix A) to provide guidance.37 Subsequently, effective September 9, 2024, amendments to the Supreme Court Civil Rules (Rule 22-2(6.1)) and Family Rules (Rule 10-4(6.1)) formally permit commissioning affidavits by video, removing the previous requirement that in-person attendance be medically unsafe.38 COVID-specific court notices regarding affidavits were rescinded.38 This offers convenience but requires careful adherence to the prescribed procedures.32  
* **Digital Desk Orders (Provincial Court):** For certain matters not requiring a hearing, Provincial Court judges can now review and sign court orders electronically, speeding up the process and allowing orders to be handled from anywhere in the province.36  
* **French Language Rights in Divorce Proceedings:** Amendments to the federal *Divorce Act* and BC Supreme Court Family Rules came into force on December 1, 2024\. These changes allow parties involved in divorce proceedings in the BC Supreme Court to use French throughout the process – including filing documents, participating in hearings, giving evidence, and receiving orders in French. This right extends to related provincial family law claims (like those under the *Family Law Act*) when brought together with the divorce claim in the same proceeding.40

Significance and Practical Implications:  
These technological and procedural shifts require adaptation from lawyers, litigants, and court staff.

* Users must become proficient with online platforms like COBS for scheduling, especially for trials in major urban centres.31 The move away from immediate phone booking to an algorithm-based allocation system in busy courts changes the dynamic of securing trial dates.31  
* Preparation for virtual hearings, including ensuring access to reliable technology, remains essential.32  
* Compliance with e-filing protocols and formatting standards is mandatory.32  
* The formalization of remote affidavit commissioning provides flexibility but demands careful execution according to the rules.37  
* Overall, these changes represent a significant move away from traditional paper-based, in-person court interactions towards a more digital and remote model.31 While intended to enhance efficiency and potentially access 31, these technologies can also create challenges. A "digital divide" may disadvantage self-represented litigants or those lacking necessary technology, skills, or support, potentially impacting their ability to navigate the justice system effectively.41  
* The expansion of French language rights in divorce matters significantly improves access to justice for French-speaking individuals in BC.40

## **Conclusion**

The civil litigation landscape in British Columbia underwent notable changes during 2024-2025. Key developments reshaped aspects of class action practice, particularly concerning government plaintiffs and privacy breach liability. Significant legislative reforms under Bill 4 promise to bolster consumer rights and alter how businesses contract with consumers and handle disputes. Important case law reinforced fundamental principles of contract law within the employment context, emphasizing the need for clear terms and proper consideration. Concurrently, the courts continued their push towards modernization, integrating technology more deeply into scheduling, filing, and hearing processes.

These shifts underscore the dynamic nature of civil law and procedure in BC. Individuals and businesses involved in or potentially facing litigation must remain aware of how these evolving rules and interpretations might affect their rights, obligations, and strategies. Whether dealing with large-scale class actions, consumer contracts, employment agreements, data privacy concerns, or simply navigating court procedures, understanding the current legal environment is essential.

Given the complexity and potential impact of these developments, it is strongly recommended that individuals and businesses seek tailored legal advice from a qualified professional regarding any specific concerns or potential litigation matters they may face.
