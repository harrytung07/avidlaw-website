## Modernizing Court Procedures in BC  
The courts in BC have introduced several measures to make litigation more efficient and accessible:

- **Remote and Digital Processes:** The BC Supreme Court permanently updated its rules to allow affidavits (sworn statements) to be taken remotely via video conference ([
	CBA British Columbia - 2024
](https://www.cbabc.org/Newsroom/In-The-Media/2024?page=6#:~:text=Effective%20September%209%2C%202024%20the,attend%20physically%20before%20a%20commissioner)). Previously, remote witnessing of affidavits was permitted only under COVID-19 safety measures; now it’s a standard option. This means you can swear court documents before a commissioner or lawyer online, without needing to attend in person – a convenient change for those in remote areas or with mobility concerns.  

- **Online Scheduling:** As of late 2024, the Supreme Court expanded its **Court Online Booking System (COBS)** to include trial scheduling ([

](https://www.bccourts.ca/supreme_court/#:~:text=Beginning%20on%20November%201%2C%202024%2C,by%20Associate%20Chief%20Justice%20Holmes)). Parties and lawyers can now book civil and family trial dates through an online portal, building on a system first introduced for case conferences in 2020. This online scheduling reduces delays and phone tag with court registries, making it easier to secure court dates.  

- **Electronic Filing and Hearings:** Electronic court filing has become standard, and many routine hearings (e.g. case conferences and some short motions) continue to be held by video or telephone. What started as a pandemic necessity is now part of normal practice. Litigants benefit from lower travel costs and the ability to attend brief court appearances remotely. There is ongoing discussion about expanding virtual hearings for certain **Chambers** matters (short applications), as the bar has noted the efficiency of online attendance.  

- **Addressing Backlogs:** To tackle delays, the provincial government has been increasing judicial resources. In September 2024, **two new judges** were appointed to the BC Provincial Court to “support consistent and timely access to justice” ([
	CBA British Columbia - 2024
](https://www.cbabc.org/Newsroom/In-The-Media/2024?page=6#:~:text=B,to%20Provincial%20Court)). More judges and court staff mean civil cases – from small claims to supreme court actions – can be heard sooner, helping clear the backlog that built up during the pandemic. Courts are also publishing annual reports with statistics and improvements, underscoring transparency in how they are managing caseloads.

## Small Claims and Online Dispute Resolution  
Significant reforms to how smaller civil disputes are resolved have taken effect, emphasizing online resolution and tribunal processes:

- **Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) for Minor Claims:** British Columbia has moved many small claims online. The **Civil Resolution Tribunal** now handles most claims up to $5,000 in value, using a digital platform ([Small claims court - procedures and fees - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/courthouse-services/small-claims#:~:text=As%20of%20June%201%2C%202017%2C,the%20Civil%20Resolution%20Tribunal%20Act)). Using the CRT is mandatory for most disputes under this limit, covering issues like debt claims, personal property disputes, and minor car accident claims. The CRT process is designed to be user-friendly and cost-effective – you can file a claim, submit evidence, and even attend mediation or get a decision, all via the internet. This frees up the courts and provides a quicker route for minor cases.

- **Small Claims Court Jurisdiction:** Traditional Small Claims Court (part of the BC Provincial Court) continues to hear cases between $5,001 and $35,000 ([Small claims court - procedures and fees - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/courthouse-services/small-claims#:~:text=As%20of%20June%201%2C%202017%2C,the%20Civil%20Resolution%20Tribunal%20Act)). The monetary ceiling was raised to $35,000 a few years ago, and it remains at that level in 2024. Notably, **simplified trial procedures** have been implemented at certain court locations (Robson Square in Vancouver and Richmond) for claims up to $10,000 ([Small claims court - procedures and fees - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/courthouse-services/small-claims#:~:text=As%20of%20June%201%2C%202017%2C,the%20Civil%20Resolution%20Tribunal%20Act)). These pilot procedures streamline trials by using simpler rules of evidence and time limits, helping self-represented parties resolve disputes faster. If you have a claim in this range, the court may direct it into a simplified trial track for an expedited hearing.

- **Auto Accident Claims Changes:** The province’s approach to motor vehicle injury claims has dramatically changed. As part of the 2021 shift to a “no-fault” insurance model, the CRT was given exclusive authority to decide if an injury from a motor vehicle accident is a “minor injury” and to adjudicate injury claims up to $50,000 ([Update on the CRT’s Jurisdiction over Motor Vehicle Injury Disputes - BC Civil Resolution Tribunal](https://civilresolutionbc.ca/blog/update-on-the-crts-jurisdiction-over-motor-vehicle-injury-disputes/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20for%20motor,within%20the%20CRT%E2%80%99s%20exclusive%20jurisdiction)). In 2022, the BC Court of Appeal upheld this regime (and the Supreme Court of Canada declined to interfere), so as of 2024 these rules firmly remain in place ([Update on the CRT’s Jurisdiction over Motor Vehicle Injury Disputes - BC Civil Resolution Tribunal](https://civilresolutionbc.ca/blog/update-on-the-crts-jurisdiction-over-motor-vehicle-injury-disputes/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20for%20motor,within%20the%20CRT%E2%80%99s%20exclusive%20jurisdiction)). **Practical impact:** If you’re injured in a car accident in BC after April 1, 2019 and your injuries are within the defined “minor” category or your claim is under $50k, you generally cannot sue in the BC Supreme Court. Instead, you must go through the CRT for compensation, and the court will dismiss lawsuits that fall under the tribunal’s jurisdiction. Only in exceptional cases (where it’s not in the interests of justice for the CRT to handle it) would a court allow a civil lawsuit to proceed. This change has reduced the number of car accident lawsuits and aims to lower insurance costs, but it also means individuals give up the right to a traditional court process for most auto injury disputes.

- **No More Automatic Appeals from CRT Decisions:** An important change for those using the CRT is the removal of the **“Notice of Objection”** process as of July 1, 2022 ([Changes to the Notice of Objection Process - BC Civil Resolution Tribunal](https://civilresolutionbc.ca/blog/changes-to-the-notice-of-objection-process/#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%2C%20the%20BC,are%20effective%20July%201%2C%202022)). Previously, if you disagreed with a CRT small claims decision (for claims under $5,000), you could file a notice of objection within 28 days and start fresh in Small Claims Court (essentially an automatic appeal) ([Changes to the Notice of Objection Process - BC Civil Resolution Tribunal](https://civilresolutionbc.ca/blog/changes-to-the-notice-of-objection-process/#:~:text=A%20participant%20can%20only%20file,or%20before%20June%2030%2C%202022)). Now, CRT decisions in small claims matters are final and binding, just like a court judgment, unless you pursue a **judicial review** in the BC Supreme Court ([Changes to the Notice of Objection Process - BC Civil Resolution Tribunal](https://civilresolutionbc.ca/blog/changes-to-the-notice-of-objection-process/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20judicial%20review%3F)). A judicial review is not a re-trial but a check for jurisdictional errors or unfairness. This means participants must put their best case forward in the CRT process itself – you generally get no “second chance” trial. The elimination of easy appeals makes the system more efficient, but also places greater importance on the tribunal’s decision-making. If you receive a CRT decision you believe is flawed, you should seek legal advice promptly about a possible judicial review, as strict time limits apply.

## Notable Court Decisions in 2024-2025  
BC courts have delivered several important judgments in the past year that clarify the law and have real-world implications for civil litigants. Below are some highlights:

- **Indigenous Rights and Resource Projects:** In *Thomas v. Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.* (2024 BCCA 62), a landmark case, the BC Court of Appeal addressed the conflict between industrial development and Aboriginal rights. The Court confirmed that an Indigenous group’s established Aboriginal fishing rights can ground a private law claim (in this case, nuisance) against a company operating a dam ([BC Court of Appeal Confirms the Defence of Statutory Authority Applies where Aboriginal Fishing Rights are Engaged - Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=54008c01-3262-4c0f-9031-c15af9f19246#:~:text=Despite%20upholding%20the%20bulk%20of,subject%20of%20the%20underlying%20claim)). However, the Court upheld the **defence of statutory authority** – meaning that because the dam’s operations were authorized by statute, the company (Rio Tinto) was not liable for the harm to the fishing rights. Importantly, the judges varied the lower court’s declaration to explicitly state that the provincial and federal **governments have a fiduciary duty to protect the First Nations’ fishing rights** through proper river management ([BC Court of Appeal Confirms the Defence of Statutory Authority Applies where Aboriginal Fishing Rights are Engaged - Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=54008c01-3262-4c0f-9031-c15af9f19246#:~:text=Despite%20upholding%20the%20bulk%20of,subject%20of%20the%20underlying%20claim)). *Practical takeaway:* Large projects authorized by government can still infringe Indigenous rights, but the onus is on the Crown to safeguard those rights. For communities and businesses, this decision clarifies who may be held accountable when public approvals and private operations collide with Aboriginal rights – governments might face future litigation if they fail to uphold their duties, even if the private operator is spared from liability.

- **Defamation in the Digital Age:** Courts in BC are signaling zero tolerance for malicious defamation, whether in business or politics. In 2024, the Court of Appeal upheld a **record-setting defamation award** of **$1.5 million** against a company and its executives who ran a calculated online smear campaign against a competitor ([B.C. Court of Appeal upholds $1.5 million defamation award against traffic control firm and its executives | HR Law Canada](https://hrlawcanada.com/2024/11/b-c-court-of-appeal-upholds-1-5-million-defamation-award-against-traffic-control-firm-and-its-executives/#:~:text=The%20British%20Columbia%20Court%20of,known%20as%20The%20Ansan%20Group)). The defendants in that case (involving two traffic control firms) had orchestrated false allegations of criminal conduct against their rival, and the hefty damages affirmed on appeal underscore the serious consequences of online libel. Similarly, in early 2025, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by a former school board trustee who was found liable for defaming a fellow trustee by referring to her as “that strip-tease artist” during an election campaign ([BC court of appeal finds “ideological battle” no justification for defamation of school trustee - Dentons Commercial Litigation Blog](https://www.commerciallitigationblog.com/bc-court-of-appeal-finds-ideological-battle-no-justification-for-defamation-of-school-trustee/#:~:text=In%20Neufeld%20v,Bondar%E2%80%99s%20reputation)). The court held that this insult went beyond fair commentary and was a “demeaning denigration” of the plaintiff’s reputation ([BC court of appeal finds “ideological battle” no justification for defamation of school trustee - Dentons Commercial Litigation Blog](https://www.commerciallitigationblog.com/bc-court-of-appeal-finds-ideological-battle-no-justification-for-defamation-of-school-trustee/#:~:text=In%20Neufeld%20v,Bondar%E2%80%99s%20reputation)). *Practical takeaways:* Freedom of speech has limits – whether you’re a business owner posting about a competitor or a citizen opining about a public figure, false and derogatory statements can lead to substantial legal liability. The high damages and firm language from the courts signal that **cyber libel and character attacks** will be taken very seriously in BC. Individuals and businesses should think twice before publishing accusations on social media or other platforms; if statements can’t be proven true or defensible as fair comment, don’t post them.

- **Employment Contracts – Limiting Severance:** A notable employment law decision from the BC Court of Appeal in July 2024 provided clarity on termination clauses in employment contracts. The court upheld the enforceability of a clause that expressly incorporated the statutory minimum notice and severance provisions of the Canada Labour Code ([British Columbia, Canada Court of Appeal Affirms Enforceability of Termination Clause That Incorporated by Reference Notice and Severance Provisions of Canada Labour Code | Littler](https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/british-columbia-canada-court-appeal-affirms-enforceability#:~:text=,words%20in%20a%20termination%20clause)). In plain terms, the employer’s contract limited the employee’s dismissal package to the amount required by law (which is often much less generous than what common law would provide as “reasonable notice”). The Court found that the clause was drafted clearly enough to rebut the presumption that an employee is entitled to common law notice ([British Columbia, Canada Court of Appeal Affirms Enforceability of Termination Clause That Incorporated by Reference Notice and Severance Provisions of Canada Labour Code | Littler](https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/british-columbia-canada-court-appeal-affirms-enforceability#:~:text=,words%20in%20a%20termination%20clause)). *What this means:* Employers have a green light – if they draft termination clauses with careful, unambiguous reference to employment standards legislation, those clauses can be upheld, preventing employees from later claiming larger common-law notice awards. Employees, on the other hand, should be aware that signing a contract with such a clause likely restricts their severance to the minimums in employment standards law. It’s more important than ever for workers to understand their contracts at the start of employment (or seek legal advice), and for employers to review their template contracts to ensure termination language is clear and compliant.  

- **Limitation Periods and Filing Deadlines:** The courts continue to strictly enforce limitation periods in civil claims. In *Delfs v. Stricker* (2024 BCCA 35), the Court of Appeal clarified when the clock starts running for third-party claims (claims for contribution and indemnity against another party). The Court disagreed with a previous interpretation and held that a defendant “discovers” a third-party claim as soon as they are served with a pleading that, if proven, could make them pay more than their fair share of damages ([Discovering Limitations: BCCA Offers Clarity on when the Clock Starts Running, Arman Brar](https://news.brownleelaw.com/post/102iunt/discovering-limitations-bcca-offers-clarity-on-when-the-clock-starts-running#:~:text=The%20Court%20held%20that%20the,or%20more%20persons%2C%20is%20obiter)). This means defendants cannot wait for a plaintiff to formally point fingers at others before bringing in additional parties – once you know another party might be responsible, the two-year limitation to initiate a third-party claim begins. More broadly, BC’s **Limitation Act** imposes a general **two-year limitation period** for most civil actions (from the date you discovered the claim) and a 15-year ultimate limitation long-stop ([Statute of Limitations in BC: Changes and How to Navigate the Act - Spectrum Family Law](https://www.spectrumfamilylaw.ca/blog/bc/statute-of-limitations-in-bc-changes-and-how-to-naviate-the-act/#:~:text=Usually%2C%20the%20general%20limitation%20period,section%203%20of%20the%20Act)). Exceptions exist (for example, no limitation for certain assault/abuse claims), but by and large, if you delay past two years, you lose the right to sue. *Practical advice:* **Do not sit on your rights.** If you’re involved in a dispute – whether it’s a contract issue, an injury, or any loss – consult a lawyer early to determine the applicable limitation deadline. The recent case law shows that even nuanced points (like adding third parties to a lawsuit) are subject to strict timing rules. Courts have little sympathy for those who miss deadlines, even for understandable reasons, so timely action is crucial to preserve your claims.

## Access to Justice and Legal Service Innovations  
Beyond courts and cases, British Columbia has been pursuing initiatives to improve access to justice:

- **Legal Professions Reform:** A significant legislative change came in 2024 with the introduction of the **Legal Professions Act** (LPA). This new law, which received Royal Assent in May 2024, will create a *single regulator* for all legal professionals and pave the way for a new class of legal service providers ([Legal Professions Regulatory Reform - govTogetherBC](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/engagement/legal-professions-reform/#:~:text=Act%20www,regulated%20paralegal%20to%20assist%20them)). Under the LPA, lawyers, notaries public, and *licensed paralegals* will all be regulated by one body, **Legal Professions BC**, rather than separate organizations. The reform’s goal is to expand affordable legal services – for example, in the near future British Columbians may have the option to hire a **“regulated paralegal”** for certain simpler legal matters at lower cost than a lawyer ([Legal Professions Regulatory Reform - govTogetherBC](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/engagement/legal-professions-reform/#:~:text=Act%20www,regulated%20paralegal%20to%20assist%20them)). This could include assistance with small claims, straightforward civil disputes, or tribunal hearings. For the public, the LPA should mean more choice and competition in the legal marketplace, potentially reducing costs and improving access. The law is being implemented gradually (a transitional board and framework are underway ([Legal Professions Regulatory Reform - govTogetherBC](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/engagement/legal-professions-reform/#:~:text=The%20LPA%20establishes%20several%20transitional,council%2C%20and%20an%20advisory%20committee))), so these changes will roll out over the next couple of years. Law firms are preparing for an adjusted landscape where multidisciplinary teams of lawyers and paralegals can serve clients more flexibly. 

- **Public Information and Self-Help:** There’s a continued emphasis on making the justice system navigable for self-represented litigants. BC’s Justice Ministry and various organizations have expanded online resources like the **Supreme Court BC** and **Court of Appeal BC** guide websites, *Clicklaw*, and the People’s Law School materials. These offer free guides on court procedures, forms, and legal terminology in plain language. While not a change in law, it’s a noteworthy development that in 2024 the **People’s Law School** and other non-profits ramped up efforts to educate the public about civil law rights and process (for instance, publishing easy-to-understand articles on the Limitation Act changes ([Statute of Limitations in BC: Changes and How to Navigate the Act - Spectrum Family Law](https://www.spectrumfamilylaw.ca/blog/bc/statute-of-limitations-in-bc-changes-and-how-to-naviate-the-act/#:~:text=In%202013%2C%20the%20Limitation%20Act,within%20the%20legal%20landscape%20today)) ([Statute of Limitations in BC: Changes and How to Navigate the Act - Spectrum Family Law](https://www.spectrumfamilylaw.ca/blog/bc/statute-of-limitations-in-bc-changes-and-how-to-naviate-the-act/#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways))). Access to justice isn’t only about new laws – it’s also about awareness. Individuals and small businesses are encouraged to make use of these resources to better understand the litigation process, prepare for court, or explore alternatives like mediation.

- **Continuing Focus on Efficiency:** The overarching theme of recent reforms is efficiency **without sacrificing fairness**. Courts and tribunals are leveraging technology (e-filing, online dispute resolution) and new policies (streamlined trials, flexible commissioning of documents) to lower the cost and time investment required in civil disputes. The legal community, through bodies like the Canadian Bar Association BC branch, is closely involved – providing feedback on what works and what doesn’t. Expect further tweaks: for example, we may see more **specialized courts or dockets** for certain case types, expanded use of judicial mediation, or rule changes to simplify evidence and disclosure in smaller cases. All these are aimed at making the civil justice system more user-friendly for ordinary citizens.

**Conclusion:**  
For anyone involved in a civil dispute in British Columbia – whether you’re suing over a contract, dealing with a property issue, or seeking damages for an injury – the landscape in 2024-2025 offers both new opportunities and cautions. On one hand, resolving claims has become more accessible: small claims can be handled online, procedural hurdles are easing, and alternative service providers will soon be available to assist. On the other hand, the importance of acting promptly and responsibly has only been reinforced: limitation periods are strict, and courts are ready to impose stiff penalties for abuses like defamation or needless delays. The takeaway is clear: **stay informed** about these developments, and when in doubt, seek professional legal advice early. With the civil justice system in BC evolving, a knowledgeable guide – be it a lawyer or a licensed paralegal in the future – can help you navigate the process and protect your rights under the new rules. By understanding the recent changes outlined above, individuals and businesses can better position themselves in any legal dispute, leading to more efficient and fair outcomes.
