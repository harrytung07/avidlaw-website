**BC Supreme Court Streamlines Process for Advising Accused of Language Rights (CPD-10)**

The BC Supreme Court has taken steps to refine the process concerning an accused person's language rights with the issuance of Criminal Practice Direction 10 (CPD-10), titled "Language of the Accused." Announced on April 25, 2025, by Associate Chief Justice Holmes, this direction revises the procedures for ensuring individuals are properly informed of their rights under section 530 of the *Criminal Code*. This section is fundamental to Canadian justice, guaranteeing an accused the right to be tried in either English or French. Ensuring this right is understood and can be exercised if desired is a cornerstone of a fair trial.

A key feature of CPD-10 is its move towards greater procedural efficiency. Notably, if an accused person has already been formally advised of their section 530 language rights during proceedings in the Provincial Court, a new inquiry into this matter will generally not be required upon their case reaching the Supreme Court. Furthermore, CPD-10 introduces a new mechanism whereby counsel can directly advise their client of these rights, complete a designated form with the accused to confirm this advisement, and then file this form with the appropriate Supreme Court Registry. This approach acknowledges prior steps taken within the justice system and aims to reduce redundancy, potentially speeding up the initial stages of Supreme Court criminal matters.

This new practice direction is designed to enhance the overall efficiency of court proceedings while steadfastly upholding the fundamental language rights of accused individuals. By allowing counsel to manage this advisement process and by minimizing duplicative inquiries, the Court aims to streamline the preliminary stages of criminal cases. This shift also encourages defence counsel to take a more proactive role in discussing language rights with their clients from the outset. Such early and thorough discussions can lead to a better-informed accused and ensure that any preference for proceedings in a specific official language is communicated promptly, thereby facilitating smoother court administration and resource allocation, such as the timely arrangement of interpreters or bilingual judicial resources if needed.
