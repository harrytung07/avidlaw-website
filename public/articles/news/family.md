# **Staying Informed: Key BC Family Law Updates for 2024-2025**

Family law is a dynamic area, constantly evolving to reflect societal changes, address new challenges, and refine how rights and responsibilities are determined when relationships end. For individuals and families navigating separation or divorce in British Columbia, understanding recent legal developments is essential. Changes in legislation, significant court decisions, and updates to court procedures can directly impact outcomes related to children, property division, and financial support.

This article provides an accessible overview of several key developments in British Columbia family law that occurred during 2024 and early 2025\. It is designed to inform clients and the public about important shifts in the legal landscape. We will explore recent amendments to BC's *Family Law Act* concerning pension division, landmark rulings from the BC Court of Appeal on critical issues like family violence in parenting disputes, the division of property under the concept of significant unfairness, and the enforceability of separation agreements. Additionally, we will discuss the expansion of the Provincial Court's Early Resolution Process and touch upon the continuing influence of federal *Divorce Act* reforms and ongoing advocacy efforts within the province.

Understanding these changes can help individuals better comprehend their rights, obligations, and the options available to them as they move through the separation process.

## **Legislative Update: Modernizing BC's *Family Law Act***

Legislative amendments are a primary way family law adapts over time. In British Columbia, recent changes have focused on refining specific aspects of the *Family Law Act* (FLA), particularly concerning the complex issue of pension division upon separation.

### **Focus: Pension Division Reforms (Effective January 1, 2025\)**

**Background:**

Dividing pension benefits accumulated during a relationship is often one of the more technical aspects of separating family property. British Columbia has specific rules governing this process outlined in Part 6 of the *Family Law Act*. Recognizing that these rules needed updating to reflect current pension practices and address areas of ambiguity, the provincial government turned to the British Columbia Law Institute (BCLI). BCLI is an independent, non-profit society dedicated to law reform.1

Following extensive research, consultation with experts (including pension and family lawyers, plan administrators, and actuaries), and public input, BCLI published its detailed *Report on Pension Division: A Review of Part 6 of the Family Law Act* in March 2021\.1 This report contained numerous recommendations aimed at clarifying, modernizing, and improving the efficiency and fairness of BC's pension division regime.1

The provincial government subsequently introduced Bill 17, the *Family Law Amendment Act, 2023*, which received Royal Assent (became law) on May 11, 2023\.1 This legislation implemented many of BCLI's recommendations.1 While some changes took effect immediately in 2023, several key amendments impacting Part 6 of the FLA were specifically scheduled to come into force on **January 1, 2025**, alongside related changes to the Division of Pensions Regulation.3 The reliance on BCLI's work for these technical amendments underscores a practical approach to law reform, leveraging specialized expertise to address complex areas like pension law, potentially setting a precedent for future updates in technically demanding fields.1

**Key Changes Explained (Effective Jan 1, 2025):**

The amendments that took effect on January 1, 2025, aim to provide greater clarity and modernize the rules in several key areas 3:

* **Locked-In Retirement Accounts (LIRAs) and Life Income Funds (LIFs):** The amendments explicitly clarify that funds held in LIRAs and LIFs are subject to the division rules under Part 6 of the FLA.3 This confirms that these common types of locked-in retirement savings vehicles, often derived from pension transfers, are considered divisible family property.  
* **Private Annuities:** The rules now specify that the FLA's pension division provisions apply to privately purchased annuities *only when the annuity is "in pay"* – meaning when payments are actively being received by the annuitant.3 This clarifies the treatment of annuities that may have been purchased but have not yet started making payments.  
* **Assignment of Survivor Benefits:** The process for dealing with survivor benefits payable after the pension member's death (and after pension payments have begun) has been simplified and clarified.3 Previously, a spouse could waive their entitlement using Form P5. This form is now repealed.3 Under the new rules, if spouses agree (or a court orders) that survivor benefits received by the surviving spouse should be paid, in whole or in part, to another person (like a former spouse), the spouse receiving the benefits must provide notice to the plan administrator using a new prescribed form (expected to be Form P10).3  
* **Calculation of Commuted Value:** The legislation includes updates to modernize the rules surrounding how the commuted value (the estimated lump-sum value) of a defined benefit pension is calculated for division purposes.5  
* **Commuted Value Transfer Options for Limited Members:** A significant clarification addresses the ability of a "limited member" (the non-member spouse entitled to a share of the pension) to transfer their proportionate share of the commuted value out of a defined benefit (DB) pension plan.3 The amendments state that the limited member can only elect this option *if the pension plan's rules also permit the plan member* to take a commuted value transfer under similar circumstances (e.g., upon reaching early retirement age).3 If the plan member doesn't have the right to a lump-sum payout at that point, the limited member likely won't either, unless the plan text is specifically amended.3 This change, while providing clarity, might reduce the flexibility previously available to some limited members, potentially tying their receipt of funds more closely to the member's retirement decisions and the plan's rules rather than allowing an immediate lump-sum payout for a cleaner financial separation.3  
* **Administrator Fees:** The maximum fees that pension plan administrators can charge for processing pension division have been increased.3 For example, the fee for registering a spouse as a limited member of a plan increases from $750 to $1,000, and the fee for transferring funds from a defined contribution (DC) account rises from $175 to $200.3 The amendments also clarify that administrators *must* deduct these fees directly from the benefit payments being divided, unless one or both spouses arrange to pay the fee separately.3  
* **Annual Notice to Limited Members:** Plan administrators are now required to provide an annual notice to limited members who have not yet started receiving their share of the pension benefits. This notice must inform the limited member of the earliest date they are eligible to begin receiving their pension entitlement.5

These changes involved amendments to several sections of the *Family Law Act*, including sections 110, 115, 126, 140, 144, and 145\. New sections 110.1, 117.1, 118.1, and 126.1 were added, and section 118 was repealed, all effective January 1, 2025\.8

**What This Means for Separating Spouses (Practical Implications):**

These legislative updates have tangible consequences for separating couples in BC:

* **Clarity on Divisible Assets:** The explicit inclusion of LIRAs and LIFs, and the clarification regarding annuities in pay, removes potential ambiguity about whether these common retirement assets are subject to division under the FLA.3  
* **Lump Sum Option May Be Limited:** The change regarding commuted value transfers for limited members is crucial. A non-member spouse hoping to receive their pension share as a lump sum to invest elsewhere or use for immediate needs may find this option unavailable if the plan member doesn't also have that right under the plan's rules at the relevant time. This could necessitate waiting for the member to retire to receive a share of the monthly pension payments.3  
* **Survivor Benefit Agreements:** The new process using Form P10 provides a clearer mechanism for ensuring that agreements or court orders regarding the redirection of survivor benefits (payable after the member's death) are properly communicated to and implemented by the plan administrator.3  
* **Increased Costs:** Spouses should anticipate slightly higher administrative costs associated with pension division. Unless they agree to pay these fees directly, the amounts will be deducted from the pension funds being divided, marginally reducing the total amount available.3  
* **Better Planning for Limited Members:** The requirement for annual notices regarding pension eligibility dates will help non-member spouses plan more effectively for their own retirement income streams.5

## **Significant Court Rulings: How Recent Decisions Impact Rights**

Beyond legislative changes, the interpretation of family law by the courts, particularly appellate courts like the BC Court of Appeal (BCCA), plays a vital role in shaping how the law is applied. Several decisions from 2024 and early 2025 provide important guidance on critical issues.

### **Family Violence in Parenting Cases (*K.M.N. v. S.Z.M.*, 2024 BCCA 70\)**

**Background:**

When parents separate, determining arrangements for their children – including who makes major decisions (decision-making responsibility) and how much time the children spend with each parent (parenting time) – is governed by the principle of the "best interests of the child." This is the paramount consideration under both the federal *Divorce Act* and BC's *Family Law Act*.10 Both statutes explicitly require courts to consider the impact of family violence when assessing a child's best interests.11 The FLA, in sections 37 and 38, provides specific factors related to family violence that must be evaluated.11

**Case Summary:**

In *K.M.N. v. S.Z.M.*, a mother appealed a trial decision that granted the father equal parenting time with their child, without supervision. The mother had presented evidence alleging the father had engaged in family violence directed towards her, including physical acts (like headbutting), verbal abuse, and controlling behaviour. Some of these alleged incidents occurred while the child was nearby.10 The trial judge, however, expressed doubts about the mother's credibility, appeared to minimize the alleged violence, and focused primarily on whether the father posed a direct physical danger *to the child*.11 He ultimately ordered unsupervised, equal parenting time.10

**BCCA Decision:**

The BC Court of Appeal allowed the mother's appeal and overturned the trial judge's parenting order.10 The BCCA found that the trial judge had made several significant legal errors in his analysis, fundamentally failing to apply the requirements of the FLA regarding family violence.11 The specific errors identified included:

1. **Inadequate Analysis:** The judge did not conduct a meaningful analysis of the family violence allegations as mandated by sections 37 and 38 of the FLA. This was deemed a crucial prerequisite to determining the child's best interests.11  
2. **Failure to Make Findings:** The judge failed to make specific findings of fact regarding the alleged incidents of violence between the parents.11  
3. **Ignoring Indirect Exposure:** The judge incorrectly focused almost exclusively on whether the child was directly harmed or endangered by the father. He failed to consider the potential impact on the child of *indirectly* witnessing or being exposed to violence directed at the mother, despite the FLA explicitly requiring this consideration.10  
4. **Reliance on Myths and Stereotypes:** The BCCA found merit in the mother's argument that the trial judge appeared to rely on harmful myths or stereotypes about family violence. Specifically, the judge seemed to imply the mother might be exaggerating or raising allegations for tactical advantage in the parenting dispute, without any evidence to support such an assumption.10 The Court of Appeal was clear: assuming allegations are made for tactical reasons, without an evidentiary basis, is impermissible and constitutes a reversible error in law.10 This judicial recognition aligns with broader legal trends, including recent federal *Divorce Act* amendments and Supreme Court of Canada guidance, which caution against allowing unfounded assumptions and stereotypes – particularly the myth that women frequently fabricate abuse claims for strategic gain – to influence legal decisions.12 Such assumptions can lead to unjust outcomes and fail to protect vulnerable parties.10

**Impact (What This Means for You):**

The *K.M.N.* decision sends a strong message about how family violence must be treated in BC parenting cases:

* **Comprehensive Assessment Required:** Courts *must* consider all forms of family violence alleged, including physical, sexual, psychological, and financial abuse, as well as patterns of coercive control.10  
* **Indirect Exposure Matters:** The impact on a child of witnessing violence against a parent or other family member is a critical factor and cannot be ignored.10 This reflects a more holistic understanding that a child's safety and well-being are intrinsically linked to the safety and well-being of their caregiver, and that exposure to violence, even if not directed at the child, is harmful.10 Research confirms the negative effects on children who witness intimate partner violence.10  
* **No Room for Stereotypes:** Allegations of violence cannot be dismissed based on assumptions or stereotypes about the motivations of the person making the claim. Judges must base their findings on the evidence presented.10  
* **Fact-Finding is Essential:** Trial judges are required to make specific findings of fact regarding allegations of family violence and analyze the potential risks and impacts on the child before determining parenting arrangements.11

This ruling strengthens the position of individuals experiencing family violence when seeking parenting orders. It emphasizes the need for thorough evidence regarding the nature of the violence and its impact on the child, whether direct or indirect, and mandates that courts take these factors seriously in prioritizing the child's safety and best interests.

### **Fairness in Property Division & Support (*Healey v Healey*, 2024 BCCA 68\)**

**Background:**

Under BC's *Family Law Act*, property acquired by spouses during their relationship ("family property") is typically subject to equal division upon separation. Property owned before the relationship, or received by one spouse as a gift or inheritance from a third party, is generally considered "excluded property" and is not divided.17 However, section 95 of the FLA provides an important exception: a court can order an *unequal* division of family property or family debt if an equal division would be "significantly unfair." Establishing significant unfairness requires more than just general unfairness; it demands proof of something "objectively unjust, unreasonable or unfair in some important or substantial sense".17 Factors considered include the length of the relationship, each spouse's contributions (including contributions to the other's career or property), and whether equal division would leave one spouse unable to achieve economic self-sufficiency.17 Separately, courts determine entitlement to, and the amount of, spousal and child support, often based on income calculated using the *Federal Child Support Guidelines*.17

**Case Summary:**

*Healey v Healey* involved a 21-year marriage with three children.17 The wife had been the primary caregiver and homemaker, with limited paid employment, while the husband pursued a successful career as a financial advisor.17 Crucially, the husband held significant excluded property, primarily from a trust established before the marriage, valued at over $12 million.17 The divisible family property was valued around $5.1 million.18 During the marriage, the family had relied on income generated from the husband's excluded assets to fund their lifestyle and plan for retirement.18 The trial judge ordered an equal division of the family property and awarded the wife indefinite spousal support. However, the judge declined to order an unequal division despite the large disparity in the parties' overall wealth post-separation. Additionally, the judge excluded from the husband's income calculation $4,000 per month in tax-free payments he regularly received from KFD, a holding company connected to his excluded assets, deeming them a non-income "return of capital".17 The wife appealed both the property division and income determination.

**BCCA Decision:**

The BC Court of Appeal found the trial judge had erred on both key issues and allowed the wife's appeal.17

* **Unequal Division (s.95):** The BCCA concluded that an equal division of family property *would* be significantly unfair in this case.17 The court emphasized the need to first consider the actual financial position each party would be in after an equal split. Here, the husband would retain over $16 million (family property share plus excluded assets), while the wife would have approximately $2.25 million.17 The BCCA found this outcome significantly unfair given:  
  * The long duration of the marriage (21 years).18  
  * The wife's substantial contributions as primary caregiver, which facilitated the husband's career advancement while impairing her own earning capacity.18  
  * The family's reliance on the husband's excluded property throughout the marriage for their standard of living and retirement planning.18  
  * The inadequacy of the spousal support order alone to address the economic disadvantages faced by the wife post-separation.18 Considering these factors together, the BCCA ordered an unequal division, requiring the husband to pay the wife an additional $1 million as lump-sum compensation. This resulted in an approximate 65% share of the family property for the wife and 35% for the husband.17 The court also adjusted how tax liabilities arising from the husband's decision to liquidate assets to buy out the wife's interest in the home were handled, ensuring the wife wasn't unfairly penalized.18 This decision highlights the interconnectedness of property division and spousal support under the FLA; the court explicitly used the insufficiency of the support order as a justification for reapportioning property, suggesting a holistic approach to achieving overall fairness.18  
* **Income for Support:** The BCCA ruled that the $4,000 monthly tax-free payments from KFD (structured as shareholder loan repayments) *should* be included in the husband's income for calculating child and spousal support.17 The court rejected the trial judge's "return of capital" reasoning for support purposes, focusing instead on the substance of the payments.18 The BCCA noted that these payments were regular, ongoing, provided enhanced tax-free resources to the husband, were analogous to benefits from a trust (which are often included in income), and had been treated as part of the family's income during the marriage.17 Consequently, the court added the grossed-up equivalent of these payments ($96,000 annually) to the husband's income for support calculations, leading to revised support amounts.17 This aspect of the ruling signals a judicial willingness to look beyond the technical accounting or tax treatment of funds and consider the practical reality of the resources available to a spouse when determining support obligations, particularly under the broad discretion granted by section 19 of the *Child Support Guidelines*.17

**Impact (What This Means for You):**

*Healey* provides important clarifications:

* **Significant Unfairness (s.95):** Achieving an unequal division remains challenging, but this case demonstrates it's possible, particularly in long marriages where one spouse leaves with vastly disproportionate overall wealth (including excluded assets) and the other faces significant economic disadvantage due to their role during the marriage. Courts will scrutinize the real-world financial outcomes of an equal split.17  
* **Income Determination:** Courts can impute income for support based on regularly received funds, even if structured as loan repayments or derived from trusts or corporate holdings, if those funds enhance the payer's resources and ability to pay. Substance over form is key.17 Individuals with complex income structures should be aware that tax planning mechanisms may not shield funds from support calculations if they provide consistent financial benefit.

### **Challenging Separation Agreements (*Schrader v. Schrader*, 2025 BCCA 50\)**

**Background:**

The *Family Law Act* encourages separating couples to resolve their issues through agreements rather than court proceedings. A properly signed and witnessed written agreement dealing with property and debt division (often called a Separation Agreement) is generally binding.20 These agreements provide certainty and allow parties to structure their own affairs. However, the FLA recognizes that fairness is also paramount. Section 93 allows the BC Supreme Court to set aside or replace all or part of such an agreement if certain conditions existed when it was signed (e.g., failure to disclose significant assets/debts, one spouse taking improper advantage of the other's vulnerability) or if the agreement is "significantly unfair" based on specific factors.20 The factors for significant unfairness under s.93(5) include the length of time since the agreement was made, the spouses' intention to achieve certainty, and the degree to which they have relied on the agreement's terms.20

**Case Summary:**

In *Schrader v. Schrader*, the parties signed a separation agreement in May 2021\.20 Under the agreement, Ms. Klyne was to receive $200,000 for her share of the family home. This figure was based on the parties' shared belief or assumption at the time that the property was worth approximately $750,000.20 However, only four months later, in September 2021, Mr. Schrader sold the property for $1.18 million – a price significantly higher than the value contemplated in the agreement.20 Ms. Klyne applied to the court to set aside the property division portion of the agreement.20

**BCCA Decision:**

The BC Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision to set aside the agreement under section 93(5) of the FLA, finding it was significantly unfair.20 The core reason for this finding was the substantial and rapid difference between the property value used as the basis for the agreement ($750,000 estimate) and the actual market value realized just months later ($1.18 million).20

The BCCA endorsed the trial judge's reasoning that the "certainty disappears when the foundation for the Agreement turns out to be inaccurate".20 Because the agreement was predicated on a significantly flawed understanding of the property's value, the resulting division (where Ms. Klyne received $200,000 based on the lower estimate) was deemed significantly unfair when compared to the actual value.20

The Court also provided important clarification on how the factors in s.93(5) (time elapsed, intention for certainty, reliance) should be applied. It stated these factors are *not* tests to determine *if* an agreement is significantly unfair. Rather, they are considerations the court must weigh *after* finding significant unfairness, to decide whether it is appropriate to exercise its discretion to set aside or replace the agreement.20 This distinction potentially makes it somewhat easier to establish the existence of significant unfairness based purely on the outcome, although the court still needs to weigh the s.93(5) factors before intervening. The decision highlights the inherent tension between the legal desire for finality in agreements and the overarching goal of fairness in family law, especially when dealing with assets prone to rapid value fluctuations, like real estate in many BC markets.20

**Impact (What This Means for You):**

*Schrader* serves as a critical reminder for anyone negotiating a separation agreement:

* **Accurate Valuations are Crucial:** Relying on assumptions, outdated information, or informal estimates for significant assets like real estate carries considerable risk. Agreements based on inaccurate valuations are vulnerable to being challenged if the true market value is substantially different, especially if revealed shortly after signing.20 Obtaining formal, up-to-date appraisals is highly recommended.  
* **Finality is Not Absolute:** While courts strongly prefer to uphold agreements, section 93 provides a mechanism to correct outcomes that are "significantly unfair." A dramatic, unforeseen change in asset value shortly after signing can potentially meet this high threshold.20  
* **Market Fluctuations Matter:** The decision confirms that post-agreement market fluctuations can be relevant to the fairness assessment under s.93(5), particularly if the agreement was based on a flawed initial value.20  
* **Balancing Fairness and Prejudice:** When deciding whether to set aside an unfair agreement, courts will consider factors like reliance and potential prejudice. In *Schrader*, the husband received credit for renovations made after the agreement, showing the court attempts to balance the equities.20

Parties aiming for a truly final and binding agreement must exercise diligence in ensuring the factual basis for their property division, especially valuations, is accurate and current at the time of signing.

## **Procedural Changes: Expanding Access to Early Resolution**

Alongside changes in substantive law, BC has also been implementing significant procedural reforms aimed at improving how family law matters are handled, particularly in the Provincial Court.

### **The Early Resolution Process (ERP) Explained**

The Early Resolution Process (ERP) is a structured approach designed to help families resolve specific types of family law disputes outside of the traditional court process, or at least narrow the issues before heading to court.21 It is a mandatory first step for parties dealing with issues like parenting arrangements (parenting time and responsibilities), child support, spousal support, contact with a child, guardianship, and even property division related to companion animals, *if* their case is filed in a designated Provincial Court registry.22 The core goals are to reduce conflict, encourage settlement, provide families with information and resources early on, save time and money, and improve overall court efficiency.21 The services are provided free of charge, primarily by Family Justice Counsellors employed by the Ministry of Attorney General.21

For those in designated ERP registries, the process typically involves the following required steps before a formal court application (Form 3\) can be filed 21:

1. **Needs Assessment:** Each party meets individually with a Family Justice Counsellor. This assessment identifies the parties' legal and non-legal needs, screens for any family violence or safety concerns, provides information about resolution options (including out-of-court processes), makes referrals to community resources, and determines if consensual dispute resolution is appropriate.21  
2. **Parenting Education Program:** If the dispute involves parenting issues, parties are generally required to complete an approved parenting education program, such as the online "Parenting After Separation" course.21  
3. **Consensual Dispute Resolution (CDR):** If the needs assessor deems it appropriate (considering factors like safety and accessibility), parties must participate in at least one CDR session. This could involve mediation with a Family Justice Counsellor, engaging in a collaborative family law process, or facilitated negotiation with a child support officer.21

Only after completing these requirements (unless exempted) can a party file an Application about a family law matter to bring unresolved issues before a judge.26 Certain urgent matters, like applications for protection orders or priority parenting matters, are exempt from ERP and proceed directly to court.22 The mandatory nature of ERP in these locations signifies a substantial shift towards court-integrated alternative dispute resolution, aiming to divert cases from the traditional adversarial path where possible.21

### **Expansion Across BC**

The ERP has been implemented gradually across the province, following evaluations of its effectiveness.21 It began in Victoria in 2019, followed by Surrey in 2020, and Port Coquitlam in 2024\.21

Significant expansions occurred in 2025:

* **Effective April 1, 2025:** The ERP became mandatory in **Abbotsford, Chilliwack, and New Westminster** Provincial Court registries.21  
* **Planned for November 1, 2025:** The process is scheduled to expand to **Vancouver (Robson Square), North Vancouver, Richmond, Sechelt, and Pemberton**.21

The following table summarizes the status of Provincial Court locations regarding the Early Resolution Process:

| Court Location | Status | Effective Date |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Victoria | Active ERP Registry | Since 2019 |
| Surrey | Active ERP Registry | Since 2020 |
| Port Coquitlam | Active ERP Registry | Since 2024 |
| **Abbotsford** | **Active ERP Registry** | **April 1, 2025** |
| **Chilliwack** | **Active ERP Registry** | **April 1, 2025** |
| **New Westminster** | **Active ERP Registry** | **April 1, 2025** |
| Vancouver (Robson Square) | Future ERP Registry | November 1, 2025 |
| North Vancouver | Future ERP Registry | November 1, 2025 |
| Richmond | Future ERP Registry | November 1, 2025 |
| Sechelt | Future ERP Registry | November 1, 2025 |
| Pemberton | Future ERP Registry | November 1, 2025 |
| Other BC Locations | Partial/No ERP Requirements | Ongoing |

*Source: 21*

It's important for individuals initiating a family law case in Provincial Court to verify whether their local registry is currently designated as an Early Resolution Registry, as this dictates the required initial steps.

### **Benefits for Families**

Evaluations of the ERP, particularly in Surrey, have shown promising results.21 Key reported benefits include:

* **High Out-of-Court Resolution Rates:** Reports indicate that between 57% and 68% of families participating in ERP resolved their issues without needing to proceed to court.21  
* **Narrowed Issues:** Even for families who do proceed to court, the ERP often helps narrow the range of disputed issues.22  
* **Improved Understanding:** Participants generally report a better understanding of the family justice process, their options, and their legal and non-legal needs.21  
* **Increased Court Efficiency:** Designated registries have seen significant reductions in new family law case filings (e.g., 61% decrease in Surrey) and the total amount of court time required for these cases (e.g., 45% reduction in Surrey).21

These outcomes suggest the ERP is achieving its goals of reducing conflict, promoting settlement, and alleviating pressure on the court system, ultimately benefiting families by offering a less adversarial, potentially faster, and less expensive path to resolution.21 However, while the process includes screening for family violence and power imbalances, the mandatory nature of pre-court steps in designated locations does raise considerations about timely access for those who may feel pressured in ADR or whose urgent needs fall outside the specific exemptions.21

## **The Bigger Picture: Federal Law and BC Advocacy**

Developments in BC family law do not occur in isolation. They are influenced by federal legislation governing divorce and shaped by ongoing discussions about access to justice within the province.

### **Ongoing Impact of Federal *Divorce Act* Changes (March 2021\)**

For married couples seeking a divorce, the federal *Divorce Act* applies alongside BC's *Family Law Act*. Significant amendments to the *Divorce Act* came into force on March 1, 2021, and continue to influence family law practice across Canada, including BC.12 Key changes included:

* **Updated Terminology:** Replacing "custody" and "access" with more neutral, child-focused terms: "parenting time" (time a child spends in a person's care), "decision-making responsibility" (authority for significant decisions about a child), and "contact order" (for time spent with non-spouses like grandparents).12  
* **Best Interests of the Child Factors:** Introducing a detailed, non-exhaustive list of factors courts must consider when determining a child's best interests, with the child's physical, emotional, and psychological safety, security, and well-being designated as the primary consideration.12  
* **Emphasis on Family Violence:** Adding a comprehensive definition of "family violence" that explicitly includes patterns of coercive and controlling behaviour, psychological abuse, financial abuse, and a child's exposure to violence. Courts are mandated to consider family violence and its impact when making parenting orders.12  
* **Relocation Framework:** Establishing clearer rules and notice requirements for parents intending to relocate with a child.12  
* **Duty to Attempt Dispute Resolution:** Encouraging parties to try resolving matters through out-of-court family dispute resolution processes (like mediation or collaborative law) when appropriate.12

These federal changes, particularly the enhanced focus on the specific factors defining a child's best interests and the mandatory consideration of a broad definition of family violence, provide a strong national framework that complements and reinforces provincial laws like BC's FLA. Decisions like *K.M.N. v. S.Z.M.* reflect this national trend towards more nuanced, safety-conscious approaches in parenting matters, aligning provincial practice with the updated federal standards.10

### **Advocacy in BC: Access to Justice Concerns**

Despite legislative and procedural reforms, significant challenges related to accessing justice remain in BC's family law system. Organizations like the Canadian Bar Association, BC Branch (CBABC) actively advocate for improvements.37

In its 2025 Agenda for Justice, the CBABC highlighted key areas needing attention in family law 37:

* **Expanded Legal Aid:** A major concern is the limited scope of legal aid for family law matters in BC. Unlike all other Canadian provinces, BC does not provide legal aid funding for routine issues like divorce, resolving parenting disputes, or establishing basic child and spousal support, unless specific criteria involving family violence, safety threats, or denial of access to children are met.37 The CBABC strongly recommends expanding legal aid funding to cover these common family law problems, ensuring that assistance is available for both court proceedings and out-of-court resolution methods.37  
* **Unified Family Court:** BC currently has a divided court system for family law. The Provincial Court handles most cases but cannot make orders regarding property or debt division. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all issues, including property, but is often less accessible due to fewer locations and more complex procedures.37 The CBABC advocates for the creation of a Unified Family Court – a single court system equipped to handle all aspects of a family law case. This is seen as a way to simplify the process for litigants, reduce complexity, and improve efficiency.37

These advocacy points underscore that while procedural innovations like the Early Resolution Process aim to improve efficiency and encourage settlement, fundamental barriers related to the cost of legal services and the complexity of the court system continue to pose significant challenges for many British Columbians facing family breakdown.37 Ongoing debate surrounding the implementation of BC's new *Legal Professions Act* also touches on these access-to-justice themes, with discussions about the role of different legal service providers and the structure of legal regulation.37

## **Conclusion**

The period of 2024-2025 has seen notable activity in British Columbia family law, reflecting ongoing efforts to modernize legislation, clarify judicial interpretation, and improve court processes. Key developments include the implementation of detailed new rules for pension division under the *Family Law Act*, significant guidance from the Court of Appeal on the critical assessment of family violence in parenting cases, the factors justifying unequal property division, and the grounds for setting aside separation agreements based on significant unfairness. Furthermore, the expansion of the mandatory Early Resolution Process across more Provincial Court locations marks a continued shift towards prioritizing out-of-court dispute resolution.

These provincial changes occur within the broader context of evolving federal laws, particularly the *Divorce Act*, and ongoing advocacy aimed at addressing persistent access to justice challenges such as legal aid funding and court system structure. For families navigating separation, the legal landscape is complex and continually shifting.
