preview: 'The start of a new romantic relationship is always a happy occasion. Most couples start without worrying much about what happens if the relationship ends. Others who may be more cautious or savvy may opt to enter into cohabitation or pre-nuptial agreements to protect their assets and property. However, these agreements are not as bulletproof as people likely want them to be. And some people have learned that lesson the hard way in court.'

# Background and Timeline背景和时间线

Peter and Kathy began a marriage-like relationship in January 2017 and married in October 2020. Both were in their late fifties/early sixties at the time, were previously divorced, and had their own adult children from previous marriages. Kathy was a lab technician, and Peter worked on jobs relating to the design of boats and designing or renovating homes.

彼得和凯西于 2017 年 1 月开始了同居关系，并于 2020 年 10 月结婚。当时两人分别五十多岁和六十岁出头，之前离过婚，并在之前的婚姻中育有自己的成年子女。凯西是一名实验室技术员，彼得从事与船舶设计以及房屋设计或翻新相关的工作。

In the fall of 2018, Kathy approached Peter about signing a cohabitation agreement. Kathy wanted to protect the assets she acquired prior to their relationship including the Vancouver home that they were both living in mortgage-free. Peter, on the other hand, only had a boat, a truck, some work tools, and debt. Peter agreed. He had no desire for any of Kathy’s assets anyway.

2018 年秋天，凯西找到彼得，商量签署同居协议。凯西想保护她在他们交往前获得的资产，包括他们俩居住的无贷款的温哥华的房子。另一方面，彼得只有一艘船、一辆卡车、一些工作工具和债务。彼得同意了。反正他也不想要凯西的任何资产。

The cohabitation agreement contained the following:

同居协议内容如下：

1. Peter and Kathy’s assets would remain separate and continue to be separately owned in the event of a separation or on death,

Peter 和 Kathy 的资产将保持独立，即使分居或死亡，他们的资产仍将由各自拥有

1. Any increase in value of their respective assets and any assets later acquired using their respective assets are also considered separate assets,

各自资产的任何增值以及后来用各自资产购买的资产也视为各自的资产

1. If they wished to co-own any assets, they must: (1) register the property in joint names; or (2) record in writing that they co-own the property,

如果他们希望共同拥有任何资产，他们必须：（1）以联名登记该财产；或（2）以书面形式记录他们共同拥有该财产，

1. Co-owned property is considered co-owned in proportion to the direct monetary contributions made by each of them as opposed to indirect contributions such as labour, and

双方按各自直接投资比例拥有共同财产，而不是按非直接投资，如付出的劳动等间接贡献比例共同拥有，并且

1. The cohabitation agreement continues to apply regardless of any material changes in circumstances including if the parties get married.

无论情况发生什么重大变化，包括双方结婚，同居协议仍然适用

The cohabitation agreement also had a clause which acknowledged that the agreement may be set aside in the event of court intervention.

同居协议中还有一条条款，承认法院有权下令将同居协议作废。

In 2019, Peter and Kathy dreamed about building a home for themselves during their retirement years. They purchased a plot of land to build their dream home for $260,000 in Naramata, BC, a small unincorporated community about an hour drive south of Kelowna. Peter was eligible for the first-time home buyer’s plan (“HBP”), so Kathy asked him to contribute $5,000 of his savings to a registered retirement savings plan (“RRSP”) in his name to be used for the HBP. Kathy also added $30,000 to the RRSP giving them $35,000 to be used for the HBP. The balance was financed by a mortgage registered against Kathy’s Vancouver home. The dream home was registered in Kathy’s name.

2019 年，彼得 和凯西 梦想着为自己建造一所退休后居住的房子。他们以 260,000 加币在卑诗省Naramata购买了一块土地，建造了他们的梦想之家。Naramata是一个小型非建制社区，在Kelowna以南约一小时车程。彼得 有资格参加首次购房者计划（“HBP”），因此 Kathy 要求他将他存下来的 5,000 加币存入以他名义注册的退休储蓄计划（“RRSP”），用于 HBP。凯西 也向 RRSP 存入了 30,000加币，这样他们就有 35,000 加币用于 HBP。余额用以 凯西 的温哥华房屋为抵押获得的贷款支付。梦想之家登记在 凯西的名下。

Construction of the dream home was largely self-handled. Peter designed the home and worked on the construction site most days while living in a trailer on site. Kathy worked in the Lower Mainland on weekdays but remained very much involved.

梦想之家的建造基本都是自己完成的。彼得设计了这座房子，大部分时间都住在施工现场的拖车里，在施工现场工作。凯西平日在低陆平原工作，但也积极参与了房子的建造。

They set up a company called Sarabande to pay for constructions expenses. Kathy was the sole director and shareholder of Sarabande as Peter’s bankruptcy hindered Sarabande’s ability to open a corporate bank account.

他们成立了一家名为 Sarabande 的公司来支付建筑费用。彼得 因为破产会妨碍 Sarabande 开设公司银行账户，所以Kathy 是 Sarabande 的唯一董事和股东。

Contribution of funds into the Sarabande account were not equal. Peter would deposit his earnings from other construction projects he was working on for other clients. Kathy also contributed her own funds and obtained a construction loan for $445,000 secured against her Vancouver home—all of which was deposited into Sarabande’s account.

双方存入 Sarabande 账户的资金并不均等。彼得 会将他为其他客户从事建筑项目的收入存入账户。凯西 也贡献了自己的资金，并以她在温哥华的房子为抵押获得了一笔 445,000加币的建筑贷款——所有资金都存入了 Sarabande 的账户。

In the summer of 2020, Peter was struck in a car accident and sustained significant injuries. Despite this, Peter resumed working on the dream home a few days later. His accident caused Kathy’s mental illness to decline rapidly, and she took disability leave with reduced pay as a result. She ended up retiring without ever returning to work. Instead, Peter and Kathy dedicated their full time to finishing the dream home.

2020 年夏天，彼得遭遇车祸，身受重伤。尽管如此，几天后彼得仍继续建造梦想之家。他的事故导致凯西的精神疾病迅速恶化，她因此休了减薪病假。她最终退休了，再也没有回去工作。相反，彼得和凯西全身心投入到完成梦想之家的建造中。

Construction of the dream home ran significantly over budget. Most of the balance was covered by Kathy who cashed out investments she owned before the relationship and borrowed additional loans and lines of credits from lenders and siblings.

建造梦想之家的费用大大超出了预算。大部分余额由凯西承担，她套现了这段关系之前的的投资，并从贷方和兄弟姐妹那里借了额外的贷款和信用借款。

The dream home was finally finished in December 2021. Around that time, Kathy told Peter that she wanted to leave the dream home to her daughter in her will, shocking Peter and straining their relationship. They separated around May 2022. Peter moved out of the dream home in April 2022, and Kathy remained while renting out a portion as an Airbnb. The Airbnb proceeds were used to pay for property taxes, home insurance, and the various mortgages and loans used for the dream home. Kathy later moved back to her Vancouver home with her son.

梦想之家终于在 2021 年 12 月完工。大约在那个时候，凯西告诉彼得，她想在遗嘱中把梦想之家留给女儿，这让彼得大吃一惊，也使他们的关系变得紧张。他们于 2022 年 5 月左右分居。彼得于 2022 年 4 月搬出了梦想之家，凯西留了下来，并将一部分作为 Airbnb 出租。Airbnb 的收益用于支付地税、房屋保险以及梦想之家的各种贷款和借款。凯西后来带着儿子搬回了温哥华的家。

Peter commenced divorce proceedings and sought for unequal division of the dream home. Kathy claimed that the dream home was entirely her property based on the terms of the cohabitation agreement. The dream home was solely registered in Kathy’s name and under the cohabitation agreement, ownership of property is determined primarily by monetary contribution and not labour.

彼得提起离婚诉讼，要求不平等分割梦想之家。凯西声称，根据同居协议的条款，梦想之家完全属于她。梦想之家登记在凯西一人名下，根据同居协议，财产所有权主要依据财务投资而不是付出的劳动决定。

# The Court’s Analysis法庭的分析

The case _Nicol v. Lau_, [2024 BCSC 1866](https://canlii.ca/t/k79lh), in part determined whether the cohabitation agreement should be upheld or set aside. Sections 93(3) and 164(3) of the _Family Law Act_ provide a property agreement may be set aside or replaced in whole or in part if the agreement is “procedurally unfair”—namely if one or more of the following circumstances existed when the parties entered into the agreement:

Nicol v. Lau, 2024 BCSC 1866 一案在一定程度上决定了同居协议是否应予维持或撤销。《家庭法》第 93(3) 条和第 164(3) 条规定，如果协议“程序上不公平”，即当事双方在签订协议时存在以下一种或多种情况，则可以撤销或全部或部分更改：

1. a spouse failed to disclose significant property or debts, or other information relevant to the negotiation of the agreement;

配偶未能披露重大财产或债务，或与协议谈判相关的其他信息；

1. a spouse took improper advantage of the other spouse's vulnerability, including the other spouse's ignorance, need or distress;

配偶一方不正当地利用了另一方的弱点，包括另一方的无知、需要或窘境；

1. a spouse did not understand the nature or consequences of the agreement; or

配偶一方不了解该协议的性质或后果；或

1. other circumstances that would, under the common law, cause all or part of a contract to be voidable.

根据普通法，存在其他导致合同全部或者部分可撤销的情况。

The judge found that the cohabitation agreement was procedurally fair. The agreement contained a schedule listing all of Peter and Kathy’s assets. There was no evidence that Kathy hid her full financial picture or pressured Peter into signing the agreement. Peter also received independent legal advice before signing.

法官认为，同居协议在程序上是公平的。协议中包含一份清单，列出了彼得和凯西的所有资产。没有证据表明凯西隐瞒了她的全部财务状况或迫使彼得签署协议。彼得在签署前也获得了独立的法律建议。

The judge then had to determine whether the agreement in substance is “significantly” unfair. The term “significant” is defined in _Remmem v. Remmem_, [2014 BCSC 1552](https://canlii.ca/t/g8mqv), as something “weighty, meaningful or compelling” that is “extensive or important enough to merit attention” Section 93(5) sets out factors to consider:

然后，法官必须确定协议的实质内容是否“严重”不公平。“严重”一词在 Remmem v. Remmem, 2014 BCSC 1552 案中定义为“重要、有意义或令人信服”的情况，即“广泛或重要到值得关注的情况”。第 93(5) 条列出了需要考虑的因素：

1. the length of time that has passed since the agreement was made;

自达成协议以来已过去的时间长度

1. the intention of the spouses, in making the agreement, to achieve certainty;

配偶双方订立协议时的意图是否是保证确定性

1. the degree to which the spouses relied on the terms of the agreement.

配偶双方对协议条款的依赖程度

This step tipped the balance in Peter’s favour. Though there was little time that passed since the cohabitation agreement was made, the judge held that the construction of the dream home, plus all the steps that were taken to finish construction, were changes that were too significant to have been contemplated when devising the cohabitation agreement.

这一点上彼得占了上风。虽然同居协议签署的时间并不长，但法官认为，梦想之家的建造，以及为完成建造而采取的所有步骤，都是重大变化，在签署同居协议时必须考虑到。

Kathy’s claim to the dream home relied significantly on the facts that she shouldered most of the financial burden of construction, most of the property at issue was under Kathy’s name, and the cohabitation agreement had specific guidelines as to the steps needed designate property as jointly owned. However, other circumstances, including Peter and Kathy’s consistent representations to each other and other people that the dream home was **their** property and Peter’s extensive dedication to constructing the dream home from start to finish, were too much for the judge to disregard. If either was truly concerned about how ownership of the dream home would be decided under the cohabitation agreement, they should have had such discussions earlier. However, they did not have any formal discussion about ownership until after the dream home was constructed in December 2021.

凯西对梦想之家的所有权主要基于以下事实：她承担了大部分建设资金，大部分有争议的财产都在凯西名下，同居协议对指定财产为共同财产所需步骤有具体说明。然而，其他情况，包括彼得和凯西一直向对方和其他人表示梦想之家是他们的财产，以及彼得从始至终为建造梦想之家付出的巨大努力，都是法庭无法忽视的因素。如果他们真的关心根据同居协议如何决定梦想之家的所有权，他们应该早点讨论这一点。然而，直到 2021 年 12 月梦想之家建成后，他们才正式讨论所有权问题。

Thus, the judge found that neither Peter nor Kathy relied on the cohabitation agreement to determine ownership of the dream home. This led the judge to rule that the cohabitation agreement should be aside when determining the ownership of the dream home and that the dream home ought to be considered family property to be divided.

因此，法官认为 Peter 和 凯西都没有依赖同居协议来确定梦想之家的所有权。因此，法官裁定，在确定梦想之家的所有权时，同居协议不予考虑，梦想之家应被视为需要分割的家庭财产。

# Key takeaway要点

This case is an important reminder that certain agreements, such as cohabitation agreements, can only protect you to a certain extent. If you and your partner make decisions or act in a way about a property that suggests that you are not relying on the cohabitation agreement, the courts may find that such property is outside the bounds of the cohabitation agreement. Make sure that you always keep in mind the terms of your agreement and follow those terms, especially when dealing with property ownership.

此案提醒我们，某些协议（例如同居协议）只能在一定程度上保护您。如果您和您的伴侣就财产做出的决定或采取的行为表明您不依赖同居协议，法院可能会认定此类财产超出了同居协议的范围。请确保您始终牢记协议条款并遵守这些条款，尤其是在处理财产所有权时。

In the end, the courts will care less about words in a document and more about the actual reality and facts surrounding your situation.

最后，相比文件中的文字，法庭更关心的是您的实际情况和事实。
