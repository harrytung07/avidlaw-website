On appeal from a chambers stay order, the Court of Appeal held that **constitutional claims against the B.C. Securities Commission may be held in abeyance while an administrative investigation continues**, but struck the chambers judge’s decision to eliminate the Privacy Act claims altogether. The panel emphasised that courts should generally defer to specialised tribunals on matters within their expertise, but **Charter and privacy questions can proceed once internal processes finish**. 

The judgment is a useful roadmap for businesses and counsel facing parallel civil actions and regulatory proceedings—particularly in an era of heightened privacy scrutiny.
