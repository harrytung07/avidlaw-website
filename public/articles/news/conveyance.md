# **Navigating BC's Evolving Real Estate Landscape: Key Legal Developments in 2024-2025**

**Introduction**

British Columbia's real estate market is perpetually dynamic, characterized by fluctuating values, shifting demand, and evolving community needs. Mirroring this dynamism, the legal and regulatory framework governing property ownership, transactions, and land use is also in constant motion. For anyone involved in the BC real estate sector, staying abreast of these changes is not just advisableâ€”it's essential.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of significant legal and regulatory developments impacting real estate and conveyancing in British Columbia during 2024 and extending into early 2025\. These changes touch upon various aspects of property law and practice, affecting homeowners, prospective buyers and sellers, developers, landlords, tenants, strata corporations, and the professionals who advise them.

We will delve into several key areas of transformation, including new taxation measures aimed at curbing speculation, tightened regulations for short-term rentals, ambitious legislative efforts to increase housing density, important updates for strata property management, and noteworthy court decisions that clarify legal rights and obligations. Understanding these developments is crucial for navigating the complexities of BC's real estate landscape effectively.

**Key Legislative Updates: Reshaping Ownership and Investment**

**(A) The BC Home Flipping Tax: A New Hurdle for Short-Term Sales**

* **Background & Purpose:** Introduced as part of the provincial government's "Homes for People Plan," the BC home flipping tax aims to deter short-term speculation in the residential property market.1 The stated goal is to prioritize housing for long-term residents rather than as a commodity for quick financial gain, thereby promoting market stability and affordability.1 This tax operates independently of federal income tax rules concerning property flipping.  
* **The Mechanism:** Effective January 1, 2025, the tax applies to the net taxable income generated from the sale or disposition of residential property in BC if the property was owned for less than 730 days (approximately two years).1 Importantly, properties purchased *before* January 1, 2025, are still subject to the tax if they are sold *on or after* January 1, 2025, and were held for less than the 730-day threshold, unless an exemption applies.2  
* **Tax Rate Structure:** The tax rate is highest for properties held for the shortest duration. A 20% tax rate applies to the net taxable income if the property is sold within the first 365 days of ownership.2 The rate then decreases progressively for properties held between 366 and 729 days, reaching zero on day 730\.2 This structure directly targets rapid turnover for profit.  
* **Calculating the Holding Period:** The 730-day holding period is generally calculated from the date the property title transfers to the owner (closing date of purchase) to the date the title transfers from the owner (closing date of sale).2 Specific rules apply to pre-sale contracts, where the acquisition date is typically the date the initial contract was entered into or assigned.2 There are also rules for properties acquired through a series of transactions between related persons, potentially allowing the final owner to use the purchase date of the first related person in the series.2  
* **What Property is Taxable?:** The tax applies broadly to residential property, including properties with housing units, land zoned for residential use, and rights to acquire such properties, most notably assignments of purchase contracts (pre-sale flips).2 Certain locations are exempt, such as properties on First Nations reserve lands, Nisga'a Lands, and treaty settlement lands.4  
* **Key Exemptions (Requiring Filing):** While the tax is broad, numerous exemptions exist, primarily focused on situations where a sale within the 730-day period is driven by life circumstances rather than speculation. Crucially, most exemptions require the owner to file a BC home flipping tax return to claim them.4 Key exemptions include:  
  * *Life Circumstances:* Separation or divorce (living apart for 90+ days prior to sale); death (of the owner or a related individual, including sales in anticipation or property received via inheritance); serious illness or disability (of the owner or related individual); eligible relocation for work or post-secondary education (subject to distance requirements \- 40km+ for primary residence, 100km+ difference for secondary property); a change in household membership (e.g., birth/adoption of a child, related person moving in); involuntary termination of employment (not applicable to self-employed); threat to personal safety; bankruptcy or insolvency; destruction of the housing unit (making it uninhabitable); property expropriation; property acquired through a lottery; property acquired through inheritance or estate distribution; sale due to foreclosure; or significant delay (over 365 days) in the estimated completion date of a pre-sale contract.4  
  * *Primary Residence Deduction (Not a Full Exemption):* If the property sold was the owner's primary residence for at least 365 consecutive days before the sale, a deduction of up to $20,000 can be claimed against the taxable income.2 This reduces the tax payable but does not eliminate it entirely if the holding period is under 730 days. This deduction is not available for the assignment of pre-sale contracts.2  
  * *Builders/Developers/Renovators:* Exemptions are available for individuals and businesses whose activities involve building, developing, or substantially renovating properties.4  
  * *Related Party Transactions:* Transfers between certain related individuals or entities may be exempt.2  
* **Exemptions (No Filing Needed):** Some situations provide an automatic exemption without the need to file a return.4 These include sales of property in exempt locations (mentioned above), sales by exempt entities (such as registered charities, government bodies, Indigenous Nations, certain non-profits and housing corporations), property acquired as a beneficiary of a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), and properties used exclusively for a commercial purpose throughout the ownership period.4  
* **Filing Requirements:** A BC home flipping tax return must be filed within 90 days of the property sale if tax is owing, or if claiming an exemption that requires filing.2 No return is needed if the property was held for 730 days or more, or if an automatic exemption applies.1  
* **Practical Implications:** This tax introduces a significant consideration for anyone contemplating buying and selling BC residential property within a two-year timeframe. It necessitates careful tracking of ownership dates and relevant expenses. Understanding the scope of exemptions, particularly those related to unforeseen life events, is critical. Professional tax and legal advice is highly recommended before entering into short-term property transactions. The tax may contribute to cooling speculative activity, but its full impact on market dynamics remains to be seen. The introduction of this tax, alongside the existing Speculation and Vacancy Tax 6 and the extended federal Foreign Buyer Ban 7, underscores a coordinated government effort to reshape the housing market by discouraging investment models perceived to inflate costs for residents. The interplay and cumulative effect of these measures will be important to monitor.

**(B) Tightened Rules for Short-Term Rentals (STRs)**

* **Background & Purpose:** In response to concerns that the proliferation of short-term rentals (STRs) was removing units from the long-term housing market and exacerbating the housing crisis, the BC government enacted the *Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act*.8 The legislation aims to return a significant number of STR units to the long-term rental pool while attempting to balance the needs of the tourism sector.8  
* **Principal Residence Requirement:** A cornerstone of the new rules is the principal residence requirement, which restricts STR operations to the host's primary home plus potentially one secondary suite or accessory dwelling unit (ADU) located on the same property.8 A principal residence is defined as the home where the host resides for a longer period during the calendar year than any other location.8 This requirement applies province-wide as a minimum standard in municipalities with populations over 10,000 and in adjacent smaller communities.9 However, many areas are exempt, including municipalities under 10,000 people (unless they are near a larger municipality or opt-in), designated resort municipalities, properties on reserve lands or treaty lands (unless opted-in), regional district electoral areas (with exceptions), Islands Trust areas, and land classified as farm land.9 Eligible municipalities can apply annually to opt-out if their rental vacancy rate is 3% or higher for two consecutive years, or opt-in if currently exempt.9  
* **Key Exemptions (to Principal Residence Rule):** Beyond geographic exemptions, certain types of accommodation are exempt from the principal residence requirement, including registered strata hotels/motels, timeshare properties, home exchanges, certain fractional ownership properties, lodging linked to outdoor recreation operators, specific student or employee housing, and strata corporation guest suites.9  
* **Provincial STR Registry:** A significant change is the creation of a mandatory provincial STR registry. Effective **May 1, 2025**, all STR hosts, online booking platforms (like Airbnb, VRBO), and strata hotel platforms operating in BC must be registered with the province.8 Hosts will be required to display their provincial registration number and any required local government business licence number on their listings.8 Platforms must validate these numbers against provincial data.8  
* **End of Non-Conforming Use Protection:** The legislation explicitly removes legal non-conforming use protections for STRs.8 This means properties that were previously operating as STRs against local bylaws, but were potentially shielded by "grandfathering" rules, will lose that protection and must comply with current provincial and local regulations.  
* **Enhanced Local Government Enforcement:** The Act significantly strengthens the ability of local governments to enforce their own STR bylaws:  
  * *Business Licence Display:* Mandatory display of valid local business licence numbers on listings where required.8  
  * *Platform Accountability & Takedowns:* Platforms must remove listings that fail to comply with local business licence requirements upon request from the local government, following a defined notice process.8  
  * *Data Sharing:* Platforms are obligated to share specific listing data (e.g., host contact information, address, registration/licence numbers) confidentially with local governments on a monthly basis to aid enforcement efforts.8  
  * *Increased Fines:* Maximum fines for bylaw violations have been substantially increased. Regional districts can now pursue fines up to $50,000 via the *Offence Act* (up from $2,000), and the maximum fine through municipal ticketing systems is increased to $3,000 per infraction, per day (up from $1,000).8 Strata corporations can also levy higher fines for breaches of STR bylaws.11  
  * *Regional District Licensing Power:* Regional districts gain business licensing authority for STRs, similar to municipalities.8  
* **Provincial Enforcement:** A provincial Compliance and Enforcement Unit (CEU) has been established to oversee compliance with provincial rules, issue orders, and administer penalties.8  
* **Practical Implications:** These regulations represent a major shift for the STR market in BC. Hosts operating multiple properties that are not their principal residence (or an associated suite/ADU) in affected areas will need to cease STR operations or convert to long-term rentals. All hosts face new registration requirements by May 2025\. Increased data sharing and higher fines elevate enforcement risks. The combination of provincial baseline rules (like the registry and principal residence requirement) and enhanced local enforcement tools creates a complex regulatory environment. Hosts must be diligent in understanding and complying with both provincial mandates and specific local bylaws, which may vary significantly between communities.

**(C) Housing Density Legislation (Bills 44, 46, 47): Accelerating Development**

* **Background & Purpose:** In fall 2023, the BC government enacted a suite of legislation (Bills 44, 46, and 47\) designed to significantly increase housing supply and expedite development approvals across the province.13 This initiative, part of the broader "Homes for People Action Plan" 16, aims to address the housing crisis by mandating higher densities, particularly for "missing middle" housing types and around transit hubs, and by streamlining local government processes.13  
* **Bill 44 \- Small-Scale Multi-Unit Housing (SSMUH) & Planning Changes:**  
  * *Mandatory Upzoning:* Requires municipalities with populations over 5,000 to amend their zoning bylaws by June 30, 2024, to permit, by default, a minimum of three to four units on lots traditionally zoned for single-family or duplex homes (three units on lots \<280 sq m, four units on lots â‰¥280 sq m).13 On larger lots near frequent bus routes (service every 15 mins), up to six units must be permitted.14 This applies to houseplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes.13 Secondary suites and ADUs are also generally permitted.18 Vancouver, for instance, amended five specific zones to comply, while its R1-1 zone already met or exceeded these minimums.18  
  * *Public Hearings Eliminated:* Prohibits municipalities from holding project-specific public hearings for rezonings that align with the Official Community Plan (OCP).13 Public input is shifted to the OCP development stage.14  
  * *Proactive Planning & Housing Needs Reports (HNRs):* Mandates that municipalities update their OCPs and zoning bylaws by December 31, 2025, to accommodate housing needs projected over a 20-year horizon, based on standardized HNRs.14 Interim HNRs were due by January 1, 2025, with full updates required every five years thereafter.13  
* **Bill 46 \- Development Financing:**  
  * *Amenity Cost Charges (ACCs):* Introduces ACCs as a new mechanism for local governments to charge developers for the cost of amenities (like parks, recreation facilities, libraries, childcare) needed to service growth resulting from new development.13 ACCs are intended to provide a more transparent and predictable funding source compared to negotiated Community Amenity Contributions (CACs), particularly where proactive zoning under Bill 44 reduces the frequency of site-specific rezonings where CACs are typically negotiated.14  
  * *Expanded Development Cost Charges (DCCs):* Broadens the scope of DCCs, allowing them to fund capital costs for police stations, fire halls, and solid waste facilities.14  
* **Bill 47 \- Transit-Oriented Areas (TOAs):**  
  * *Designated TOAs:* Identifies specific TOAs around SkyTrain stations, West Coast Express stations, and major bus exchanges (104 initially listed).13  
  * *Minimum Density and Height Requirements:* Prescribes minimum permitted density (Floor Space Ratio \- FSR) and building heights within TOAs, tiered based on distance from the transit station (e.g., highest density within 200m, decreasing further out to 800m).13 Local governments must update their zoning to meet these minimums by June 30, 2024, and cannot refuse development applications that meet these requirements solely on the basis of height or density.14  
  * *Parking Minimums Eliminated:* Prohibits local governments from requiring minimum residential off-street parking spaces within TOAs (except for accessible parking).13 Developers will determine parking based on market demand and project specifics.14  
* **Implementation & Challenges:** The implementation timeline is aggressive, with zoning updates for SSMUH and TOAs required by June 30, 2024, and OCP/zoning alignment with HNRs by December 31, 2025\.13 The province allocated $51 million in capacity funding to assist municipalities.13 However, challenges have emerged. Municipalities have cited insufficient time and resources, lack of detailed provincial guidance (especially initially), potential strains on existing infrastructure (drainage, sewers, power), and the complexity of integrating new tools like ACCs with existing ones.14 Concerns have also been raised about the removal of public hearings reducing local input, potential impacts on neighbourhood character, and whether the legislation adequately addresses affordability, as market conditions and funding gaps may still hinder the construction of approved units, particularly affordable ones.19 Evidence suggests a significant percentage of approved projects in Vancouver haven't proceeded due to market factors.24  
* **Practical Implications:** This legislation fundamentally alters land use planning in BC. For developers, it potentially offers greater certainty and speed for projects aligning with new density mandates and OCPs, especially with reduced public hearing requirements and standardized TOA rules. However, they face new costs through ACCs and must navigate the transition period. For municipalities, it necessitates a massive overhaul of planning documents and processes under tight deadlines, alongside significant infrastructure planning challenges. For homeowners in previously low-density areas, it signals inevitable neighbourhood change with increased density and different housing forms. While the goal is increased housing supply, the actual impact on construction timelines and affordability will depend heavily on municipal execution, infrastructure investment, and prevailing economic conditions, factors not solely controlled by this legislation.

**3\. Strata Property Management: New Obligations and Considerations**

Recent years have brought significant updates to the *Strata Property Act* and its regulations, impacting how strata corporations are managed, funded, and equipped for the future.

**(A) Depreciation Reports: Mandatory and More Frequent**

* **Background:** Depreciation reports are vital tools for strata corporations, providing a long-term forecast of repair and replacement needs for common property and assets, along with estimated costs and funding models. They are intended to help strata councils and owners plan financially and avoid large, unexpected special levies.  
* **Key Changes (Effective July 1, 2024):** Recognizing the importance of these reports, the government implemented stricter requirements.25 Strata corporations with five or more lots must now obtain a depreciation report every five years.25 Crucially, the previous option for strata corporations to defer obtaining a report through an annual 3/4 vote at a general meeting has been eliminated.25 While transitional measures provide some leeway for compliance, the requirement is now unavoidable.25 Furthermore, effective July 1, 2025, these reports must be prepared by a professional from a list of six designated qualified professions, ensuring a standard of expertise.25  
* **Practical Implications:** This change imposes greater financial planning discipline on strata corporations. Councils must now budget for obtaining these reports regularly. The findings will likely inform CRF contributions and may necessitate increases in strata fees or planned levies to ensure adequate funding for future work. For owners and potential buyers, this provides greater transparency about the building's condition and anticipated future costs. This mandatory reporting, coupled with increased CRF contributions (discussed below), appears to be a legislative response aimed at improving the overall physical and financial health of strata buildings, potentially influenced by recent difficulties in the strata insurance market. Better maintained buildings with healthier reserve funds inherently present lower risks.

**(B) Facilitating Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging**

* **Background:** As electric vehicle adoption grows, facilitating charging infrastructure in multi-unit residential buildings like stratas has become a key priority.  
* **Key Changes (Effective May 11, 2023 & Dec 6, 2023):** Amendments to the *Strata Property Act* and new regulations aim to streamline the process.25 A formal process now exists for owners to request permission to install EV charging infrastructure related to their strata lot.25 Strata corporations must consider and respond to such requests within three months.25 To support proactive planning, strata corporations with five or more lots are mandated to obtain an "electrical planning report" assessing the building's current electrical capacity and its ability to accommodate future EV charging demands. Deadlines for obtaining these reports are December 31, 2026, or December 31, 2028, depending on the strata's location.25 Decision-making has also been eased; strata corporations can now approve certain EV charging installations or modifications to common property by a simple majority vote, rather than the previously required 3/4 vote.25 Additionally, stratas can grant short-term (up to five years) exclusive use of common property parking stalls equipped with EV charging infrastructure.25  
* **Practical Implications:** These changes make it easier for strata residents to install EV chargers. However, strata councils must now engage in proactive electrical planning and manage owner requests according to the new process. The costs associated with electrical planning reports and potential system upgrades will need to be addressed through the strata budget or levies. Emerging risks related to EV charging, such as installation standards, fire safety protocols, and insurance liability (often EV chargers themselves are not covered under the strata's building policy and require separate owner insurance), are also becoming important considerations for strata corporations.26

**(C) Contingency Reserve Fund (CRF) Contributions**

* **Key Change (Effective Nov 1, 2023):** To ensure strata corporations build adequate savings for future major repairs and replacements, the regulations now mandate a minimum annual contribution to the CRF.25 When approving the annual budget, strata corporations and sections must contribute an amount that is at least 10% of the total contribution to the annual operating fund.25 The minimum contribution required from owner developers for new strata developments was also increased.25  
* **Practical Implications:** This change enforces a baseline level of savings for long-term maintenance, aiming to reduce the frequency and magnitude of special levies. While this may lead to higher regular strata fees for some owners, it promotes better long-term financial health and predictability for the strata corporation.

**(D) Strata Insurance Market Trends**

* **Context:** In recent years (prior to 2024), the BC strata insurance market faced significant challenges, marked by sharply rising premiums, increased deductibles, and reduced coverage availability.26 Factors contributing to this included global reinsurance market hardening, increased frequency and severity of claims (particularly water damage and weather-related events like floods and storms), and rising construction/repair costs due to inflation and supply chain issues.26  
* **Current Trend (2024-2025):** Market conditions appear to be stabilizing and improving.26 Increased insurer appetite and new capacity entering the market have led to greater competition.27 Well-maintained strata corporations with positive claims histories, minimal defects, and adequate risk management (e.g., fire protection) are seeing more favourable terms, including rate stabilization and even reductions compared to peak crisis levels.26  
* **Challenges/Considerations:** Despite improvements, challenges remain. Insurers are placing greater emphasis on underwriting diligence, often requiring recent property valuations or appraisals to ensure adequate coverage for full replacement value and mitigate underinsurance risks.26 Evidence of robust fire protection systems (e.g., sprinkler flow tests) is also increasingly important.26 High-risk commercial occupancies within a strata can negatively impact premiums.26 Climate change poses a significant ongoing risk, with extreme weather events contributing to catastrophic losses.27 BC's financial services regulator (BCFSA) is actively considering climate-related risks and may adopt stricter guidelines for insurers, potentially mirroring federal OSFI Guideline B-15.28 Emerging risks, such as those associated with EV charging stations, also require attention.26  
* **Practical Implications:** While the market has softened somewhat, strata corporations must remain focused on proactive risk management. This includes regular maintenance, obtaining up-to-date valuations and risk surveys, ensuring adequate CRF funding (supported by the legislative changes above), and understanding policy details, particularly deductibles and coverage limits. Working closely with an experienced insurance broker is crucial for navigating the market and securing appropriate coverage.27

**4\. Other Noteworthy Developments**

Beyond the major legislative pushes on taxation, short-term rentals, density, and strata governance, several other developments in 2024-2025 are relevant to the BC real estate landscape.

**(A) Federal Foreign Buyer Ban Extended**

* **Change:** The federal *Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act*, which restricts certain foreign individuals and corporations from buying homes in Canada's major urban centers, was extended.7 Originally set to expire on January 1, 2025, the ban will now remain in effect until **January 1, 2027**.7  
* **Scope & Exemptions:** The ban generally applies to residential properties with three or fewer units within Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) and Census Agglomerations (CAs).7 Properties outside these areas are exempt.7 Key exemptions allow purchases by temporary residents holding valid work permits (with at least 183 days validity, limited to one property) and international students meeting specific physical presence and tax filing requirements over five years.31 Other exemptions cover refugees, diplomats, and non-Canadians purchasing with a Canadian spouse or partner.31 Amendments made in 2023 also clarified that non-Canadians can purchase vacant land zoned for residential use for development purposes.31  
* **BC Context:** This federal ban operates alongside BC's own measures targeting foreign ownership, namely the provincial Foreign Buyer Tax (an additional property transfer tax of 20% in specified regions like Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, Capital Regional District, Central Okanagan, and Nanaimo Regional District) 30 and the Speculation and Vacancy Tax (discussed below). Note that individuals confirmed under the BC Provincial Nominee Program may be exempt from the provincial foreign buyer tax if the property is their principal residence.30  
* **Practical Implications:** The extension maintains restrictions on foreign capital entering major Canadian housing markets for another two years. Real estate professionals continue to have due diligence obligations to ascertain buyer eligibility under the Act.7 The interaction between federal and provincial rules, along with the various exemptions, adds complexity to transactions involving non-Canadian buyers.

**(B) BC Speculation and Vacancy Tax Expansion**

* **Change:** Effective January 1, 2024, the geographic reach of BC's Speculation and Vacancy Tax was expanded to include an additional 13 municipalities.32 Owners of residential property in these newly added areas (which include Abbotsford, Chilliwack, Mission, Squamish, Duncan, North Cowichan, Ladysmith, and Lake Cowichan) will be required to complete their first declaration in January 2025 for the 2024 tax year.32  
* **Core Purpose & Process:** The tax continues to target properties left vacant or under-utilized in designated urban areas, as well as properties owned by foreign nationals or "satellite families" (households where the majority of income is earned outside Canada).6 All owners of residential property within the taxable regions must file an annual declaration by March 31, reporting on how the property was used in the previous calendar year.6 Failure to declare results in assessment at the maximum tax rate (2% of assessed value for foreign owners and satellite families, 0.5% for Canadian citizens/permanent residents who are not members of a satellite family).6 Recent changes also clarify that long-term leaseholders whose leases are registered at the Land Title Office are considered "owners" for the purposes of this tax.6  
* **Practical Implications:** The expansion brings more BC property owners under the purview of the annual declaration requirement. Owners in the newly added areas must familiarize themselves with the declaration process and the available exemptions (e.g., principal residence, qualifying long-term rentals, temporary absences for medical reasons, property undergoing development/renovation).6

**(C) Residential Tenancy Act (RTA) Updates**

* **Focus on Evictions:** Several recent amendments focus on tenancies ended for landlord's use of property. Since July 18, 2024, landlords issuing such notices must use the Residential Tenancy Branch's (RTB) online portal, which requires inputting specific details about the intended occupants and serves as a reminder of penalties for "bad faith" evictions.35 The period a landlord (or eligible family member) must occupy the unit to avoid bad faith penalties has been extended from six months to twelve months.36 The required notice period for landlord's use was temporarily increased from two to four months in July 2024 35, though a further regulatory change is planned for Summer 2025 to reduce it to three months, aligning it with the existing three-month notice period required when a purchaser intends to occupy the unit.36 The timeframe for tenants to dispute these notices was also extended (from 15 to 30 days for landlord's use, and 10 to 21 days for purchaser's use).35  
* **Abandoned Property:** Effective April 9, 2025, the rules regarding tenant's abandoned property change. Landlords are only required to store property valued at $1,000 or more (up from $500), and the required storage period is reduced from 60 days to 30 days.37  
* **Other Changes:** Landlords can no longer increase rent solely because a child occupant is added to the household or because an occupant who was a minor turns 19\.36 The RTB plans to begin publishing monetary orders online in Summer 2025 for increased transparency.37 The government also reports significant reductions in RTB hearing wait times.37  
* **Practical Implications:** Landlords face stricter procedural requirements and longer potential liability periods when ending tenancies for personal use. Tenants have slightly longer periods to dispute notices. The changes to abandoned property rules may reduce burdens on landlords in some situations.

**(D) Land Title and Survey Authority (LTSA) Updates**

* **Fees & E-filing:** As a regulated authority, LTSA typically adjusts most service fees annually based on the Consumer Price Index; the latest increase took effect April 1, 2025\.38 LTSA continues its transition towards fully electronic filing. A major milestone was reached with the retirement of e-filing exemptions for government entities, meaning over 97% of land title applications are now submitted electronically.39 LTSA regularly updates its E-Filing Directions, web filing form practice guides (including the Form 17 Help Guide), and the list of valid electronic forms.39  
* **Survey Plans & Security:** Modernization efforts include the introduction of "SurveyHub," an online pre-submission workspace for land surveyors.40 To enhance security, multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been implemented for all myLTSA professional user accounts.39  
* **Practical Implications:** Real estate professionals, particularly conveyancers and surveyors, must remain vigilant about current LTSA fee schedules, practice directives, form requirements, and e-filing system updates.39 Proficiency with the electronic filing system and adherence to security protocols like MFA are essential.39

**5\. Noteworthy Case Law: Clarifying Rights and Obligations**

Court decisions play a crucial role in interpreting legislation and shaping legal practice. Several recent cases offer important clarifications relevant to BC real estate and conveyancing.

**(A) *Schrader v. Schrader*, 2025 BCCA 50: Setting Aside Agreements for "Significant Unfairness"**

* **Context:** This family law appeal dealt with the enforceability of a separation agreement under BC's *Family Law Act* (FLA). The agreement divided property based on an assumed value of the family home. However, just four months after signing, the home was sold for $1.18 million, substantially more than the approximately $750,000 value used in the agreement, which had allocated $200,000 to one spouse for their interest.42  
* **Ruling:** The BC Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision to set aside the property division aspects of the agreement.42 The court agreed that the significant difference between the value underpinning the agreement and the property's actual market value, realized shortly thereafter, met the threshold for "significant unfairness" under section 93(5) of the FLA.42 The trial judge aptly noted, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that "certainty disappears when the foundation for the Agreement turns out to be inaccurate".42  
* **Key Principles:** The decision reinforces that while courts generally uphold agreements freely entered into, a substantial discrepancy between the agreed-upon value of an asset (like real estate) and its true market value can render an agreement significantly unfair, particularly if the parties were unaware of the actual value at the time of signing.42 The court clarified that the factors listed in s. 93(5) â€“ the time elapsed since the agreement, the parties' intention to achieve certainty, and the degree of reliance on the agreement â€“ are considerations in the analysis, but do not prevent a finding of significant unfairness if the factual basis of the deal was fundamentally flawed.42 Post-agreement market fluctuations can be relevant in assessing fairness, especially when they occur very soon after signing and reveal a significant error in the initial valuation.42 The court also balanced the finding of unfairness against potential prejudice, giving the paying spouse credit for post-agreement renovations.42  
* **Practical Implications:** This ruling is highly relevant for real estate transactions arising from family separations. It underscores the critical importance of obtaining current, accurate market valuations for properties being divided in separation agreements. Agreements relying on outdated or inaccurate valuations face a heightened risk of being challenged and potentially set aside if a significant value discrepancy emerges shortly after signing. This introduces a potential element of uncertainty regarding the finality of such agreements, especially in volatile real estate markets. Parties and their counsel should be diligent in establishing asset values and may consider clauses addressing potential short-term, significant value changes.

**(B) *Law Society of British Columbia v. Barker*, 2025 LSBC 4: Professional Conduct in Real Estate Transactions**

* **Context:** This was a disciplinary proceeding before a Law Society hearing panel concerning a lawyer's involvement in real estate transactions connected to an individual alleged to be involved in fraudulent activities.43  
* **Ruling:** The panel found the lawyer had committed professional misconduct.43 The misconduct stemmed from failures to adhere to the *Code of Professional Conduct*, specifically rule 3.2-7 and its commentary, which require lawyers to be vigilant against being used as tools or dupes by unscrupulous clients or others.43 The lawyer failed to make reasonable inquiries about the client's identity, the true nature and objectives of the transactions, the beneficial ownership of properties and entities involved, and other suspicious circumstances.43  
* **Key Principles:** The decision serves as a stark reminder of lawyers' gatekeeping responsibilities in financial and real estate transactions. It emphasizes the duty to make reasonable inquiries when dealing with complex, unusual, or potentially suspicious transactions, particularly regarding client identity, beneficial ownership, and the source of funds.43 It also affirmed that the commentaries accompanying the rules in the *Code of Professional Conduct* carry the same weight and authority as the rules themselves.43  
* **Practical Implications:** For lawyers practicing real estate and conveyancing, *Barker* highlights the critical importance of robust client identification and verification procedures, thorough due diligence, and heightened skepticism when red flags appear. It reinforces the ethical obligation to avoid facilitating potential fraud, money laundering, or other criminal activity, even inadvertently. Lawyers must be prepared to ask probing questions and, if necessary, decline or withdraw from retainers where suspicions cannot be reasonably allayed.

**(C) Other Cases (Brief Mention)**

While not originating in BC or directly focused on core conveyancing, other recent decisions touch upon relevant areas:

* ***G.D. v. South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority*** **(2024 BCCA, leave to SCC denied March 2025):** This case established that public bodies in BC can potentially be held liable under the provincial *Privacy Act* for failing to adequately safeguard personal information, and that reckless disregard for privacy obligations might constitute a "willful" violation actionable under the Act. This has implications for any entity, including those in the real estate sector, that handles sensitive client data.  
* ***Adams v. Thinkific Labs Inc.*** **(2024 BCSC):** An employment law decision emphasizing that significant changes to employment contracts (like adding restrictive covenants) generally require fresh consideration (e.g., a bonus or raise) to be enforceable.44 This is relevant for real estate brokerages, development companies, and property management firms in structuring their agreements with employees and independent contractors.

**6\. Conclusion**

The period from 2024 into 2025 has ushered in a wave of significant changes to British Columbia's real estate legal and regulatory environment. Key themes emerge: a concerted government effort to influence housing affordability and market stability through taxation (BC Home Flipping Tax, Speculation and Vacancy Tax) and regulation (STR rules, federal Foreign Buyer Ban extension); a push to accelerate housing supply via mandated density increases and streamlined approvals (Bills 44, 46, 47); enhanced protections for consumers and tenants (*Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act* amendments, RTA updates); and new obligations and considerations for strata property management (depreciation reports, EV charging, CRF funding, insurance market shifts). Concurrently, the Land Title and Survey Authority continues its modernization through e-filing advancements, while courts provide crucial interpretations on the enforceability of agreements (*Schrader*) and professional duties (*Barker*).

Navigating this evolving landscape requires diligence and awareness from all participants. The complexity of these interacting provincial and federal laws, coupled with ongoing market shifts, underscores the importance of staying informed. Whether buying, selling, developing, renting, managing strata property, or advising clients in these areas, understanding how these developments impact specific rights, obligations, and potential risks is paramount. Given the intricacies involved, seeking timely legal advice from experienced real estate professionals is strongly recommended to ensure compliance and make informed decisions in your specific circumstances.
